	abstract = {Many hypotheses in the field of phylogenetic comparative biology involve specific changes in the rate or process of trait evolution. We present a method designed to test whether the rate of evolution of a discrete character has changed in one or more clades, lineages, or time periods. This method differs from other related approaches (such as the {\textquoteright}covarion{\textquoteright} model) in that the {\textquoteright}regimes{\textquoteright} in which the rate or process is postulated to have changed are specified a priori by the user, rather than inferred from the data. Similarly, it differs from methods designed to model a correlation between two binary traits in that the regimes mapped onto the tree are fixed. We apply our method to investigate the rate of dewlap color and/or caudal vertebra number evolution in Caribbean and mainland clades of the diverse lizard genus Anolis. We find little evidence to support any difference between mainland and island evolution in either character. We also examine the statistical properties of the method more generally and show that it has acceptable type I error, parameter estimation, and power. Finally, we discuss the relationship of our method to existing models of heterogeneity in the rate of discrete character evolution on phylogenies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  title     = "A Factor Analytic Description of the Phanerozoic Marine Fossil
               Record",
  author    = "Sepkoski, J John",
  abstract  = "Data on numbers of marine families within 91 metazoan classes
               known from the Phanerozoic fossil record are analyzed. The
               distribution of the 2800 fossil families among the classes is
               very uneven, with most belonging to a small minority of classes.
               Similarly, the stratigraphic distribution of the classes is very
               uneven, with most first appearing early in the Paleozoic and
               with many of the smaller classes becoming extinct before the end
               of that era. However, despite this unevenness, a Q-mode factor
               analysis indicates that the structure of these data is rather
               simple. Only three factors are needed to account for more than
               90\% of the data. These factors are interpreted as reflecting
               the three great ``evolutionary faunas'' of the Phanerozoic
               marine record: a trilobite-dominated Cambrian fauna, a
               brachiopod-dominated later Paleozoic fauna, and a
               mollusc-dominated Mesozoic-Cenozoic, or ``modern,'' fauna.
               Lesser factors relate to slow taxonomic turnover within the
               major faunas through time and to unique aspects of particular
               taxa and times. Each of the three major faunas seems to have its
               own characteristic diversity so that its expansion or
               contraction appears as being intimately associated with a
               particular phase in the history of total marine diversity. The
               Cambrian fauna expands rapidly during the Early Cambrian
               radiations and maintains dominance during the Middle to Late
               Cambrian ``equilibrium.'' The Paleozoic fauna then ascends to
               dominance during the Ordovician radiations, which increase
               diversity dramatically; this new fauna then maintains dominance
               throughout the long interval of apparent equilibrium that lasts
               until the end of the Paleozoic Era. The modern fauna, which
               slowly increases in importance during the Paleozoic Era, quickly
               rises to dominance with the Late Permian extinctions and
               maintains that status during the general rise in diversity to
               the apparent-maximum in the Neogene. The increase in diversity
               associated with the expansion of each new fauna appears to
               coincide with an approximately exponential decline of the
               previously dominant fauna, suggesting possible displacement of
               each evolutionary fauna by its successor.",

              out by invalid statistical methods. Most regression, correlation,
              and contingency table methods, including nonparametric methods,
              assume that the points are drawn independently from a common
              distribution. When species are taken from a branching phylogeny,
              they are manifestly nonindependent. Use of a statistical method
              that assumes independence will cause overstatement of the
              significance in hypothesis tests. Some illustrative examples of
              these phenomena have been given, and limitations of previous
              proposals of ways to correct for the nonindependence have been
              discussed. A method of correcting for the phylogeny has been
              proposed. It requires that we know both the tree topology and the
              branch lengths, and that we be willing to allow the characters to
              be modeled by Brownian motion on a linear scale. Given these
              conditions, the phylogeny specifies a set of contrasts among
              species, contrasts that are statistically independent and can be
              used in regression or correlation studies. The considerable

               up-to-date and comprehensive coverage of modern statistical and
               computational methods used in molecular evolutionary analysis,
               such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. Yang
               describes the models, methods and algorithms that are most

  author    = "Garland, Theodore and Harvey, Paul H and Ives, Anthony R",
  abstract  = "We discuss and clarify several aspects of applying Felsenstein's
               (1985, Am. Nat. 125: 1--15) procedures to test for correlated
               evolution of continuous traits. This is one of several available
               comparative methods that maps data for phenotypic traits onto an
               existing phylogenetic tree (derived from independent
               information). Application of Felsenstein's method does not
               require an entirely dichotomous topology. It also does not
               require an assumption of gradual, clocklike character evolution,
               as might be modeled by Brownian motion. Almost any available
               information can be used to estimate branch lengths (e.g.,
               genetic distances, divergence times estimated from the fossil
               record or from molecular clocks, numbers of character changes
               from a cladistic analysis). However, the adequacy for
               statistical purposes of any proposed branch lengths must be
               verified empirically for each phytogeny and for each character.
               We suggest a simple way of doing this, based on graphical
               analysis of plots of standardized independent contrasts versus
               their standard deviations (i.e., the square roots of the sums of
               their branch lengths). In some cases, the branch lengths and/or
               the values of traits being studied will require transformation.
               An example involving the scaling of mammalian home range area is
               presented. Once adequately standardized, sets of independent
               contrasts can be analyzed using either linear or nonlinear
               (multiple) regression. In all cases, however, regressions (or
               correlations) must be computed through the origin. We also
               discuss ways of correcting for body size effects and how this
               relates to making graphical representations of relationships of
               standardized independent contrasts. We close with a
               consideration of the types of traits that can be analyzed with
               independent contrasts procedures and conclude that any
               (continuous) trait that is inherited from ancestors is
               appropriate for analysis, regardless of the mechanism of
               inheritance (e.g., genetic or cultural).",

  abstract = "Despite the many triumphs of comparative biology during the past
              few decades, the field has remained strangely divorced from
              evolutionary genetics. In particular, comparative methods have
              failed to incorporate multivariate process models of
              microevolution that include genetic constraint in the form of the
              G matrix. Here we explore the insights that might be gained by
              such an analysis. A neutral model of evolution by genetic drift
              that depends on effective population size and the G matrix
              predicts a probability distribution for divergence of population
              trait means on a phylogeny. Use of a maximum likelihood (ML)
              framework then allows us to compare independent direct estimates
              of G with the ML estimates based on the observed pattern of trait
              divergence among taxa. We assess the departure from neutrality,
              and thus the role of different types of selection and other
              forces, in a stepwise hypothesis-testing procedure based on
              parameters for the size, shape, and orientation of G. We

              used to model the evolution of two-state discrete characters

              character, called liability, that is unobserved and that

              observed. In this way, one can make a comparative-methods
              analysis that combines both discrete and continuous characters.
              Simulations are presented showing that the covariances of the
              liabilities are successfully estimated, although precision can be
              achieved only by using a large number of species, and we must
              always worry whether the covariances and the model apply
              throughout the group. An advantage of the threshold model is that
              the model can be straightforwardly extended to accommodate
              within-species phenotypic variation and allows an interface with

  abstract  = "Cyanobacteria have exerted a profound influence on the
               progressive oxygenation of Earth. As a complementary approach to
               examining the geologic record-phylogenomic and trait
               evolutionary analyses of extant species can lead to new
               insights. We constructed new phylogenomic trees and analyzed
               phenotypic trait data using novel phylogenetic comparative
               methods. We elucidated the dynamics of trait evolution in
               Cyanobacteria over billion-year timescales, and provide evidence
               that major geologic events in early Earth's history have
               shaped-and been shaped by-evolution in Cyanobacteria. We
               identify a robust core cyanobacterial phylogeny and a smaller
               set of taxa that exhibit long-branch attraction artifacts. We
               estimated the age of nodes and reconstruct the ancestral
               character states of 43 phenotypic characters. We find high
               levels of phylogenetic signal for nearly all traits, indicating
               the phylogeny carries substantial predictive power. The earliest
               cyanobacterial lineages likely lived in freshwater habitats, had
               small cell diameters, were benthic or sessile, and possibly
               epilithic/endolithic with a sheath. We jointly analyzed a subset
               of 25 binary traits to determine whether rates of trait
               evolution have shifted over time in conjunction with major
               geologic events. Phylogenetic comparative analysis reveal an
               overriding signal of decreasing rates of trait evolution through
               time. Furthermore, the data suggest two major rate shifts in
               trait evolution associated with bursts of evolutionary
               innovation. The first rate shift occurs in the aftermath of the
               Great Oxidation Event and ``Snowball Earth'' glaciations and is
               associated with decrease in the evolutionary rates around
               1.8-1.6 Ga. This rate shift seems to indicate the end of a major
               diversification of cyanobacterial phenotypes-particularly
               related to traits associated with filamentous morphology,
               heterocysts and motility in freshwater ecosystems. Another burst
               appears around the time of the Neoproterozoic Oxidation Event in
               the Neoproterozoic, and is associated with the acquisition of
               traits involved in planktonic growth in marine habitats. Our
               results demonstrate how uniting genomic and phenotypic datasets
               in extant bacterial species can shed light on billion-year old
               events in Earth's history.",

              selection. However, inference of the dynamics of adaptive
              landscapes from comparative data is complicated by
              interpretational difficulties, lack of identifiability among

               inconsistency between phylogenies and fossils limits our
               understanding of macroevolution, and it undermines our
               confidence in phylogenetic inference. Here, we show that
               realistic extinction rates and diversity trajectories can be
               inferred from molecular phylogenies. To make this inference, we
               derive an analytic expression for the likelihood of a phylogeny
               that accommodates scenarios of declining diversity,
               time-variable rates, and incomplete sampling; we show that this
               likelihood expression reliably detects periods of diversity loss
               using simulation. We then study the cetaceans (whales, dolphins,
               and porpoises), a group for which standard phylogenetic
               inferences are strikingly inconsistent with fossil data. When
               the cetacean phylogeny is considered as a whole, recently
               radiating clades, such as the Balaneopteridae, Delphinidae,
               Phocoenidae, and Ziphiidae, mask the signal of extinctions.
               However, when isolating these groups, we infer diversity
               dynamics that are consistent with the fossil record. These
               results reconcile molecular phylogenies with fossil data, and
               they suggest that most extant cetaceans arose from four recent
               radiations, with a few additional species arising from clades
               that have been in decline over the last ∼10 Myr.",

  abstract = "The distribution of diversity can vary considerably from clade to
              clade. Attempts to understand these patterns often employ
              state-dependent speciation and extinction models to determine
              whether the evolution of a particular novel trait has increased
              speciation rates and/or decreased extinction rates. It is still
              unclear, however, whether these models are uncovering important
              drivers of diversification, or whether they are simply pointing
              to more complex patterns involving many unmeasured and
              co-distributed factors. Here we describe an extension to the
              popular state-dependent speciation and extinction models that
              specifically accounts for the presence of unmeasured factors that
              could impact diversification rates estimated for the states of
              any observed trait, addressing at least one major criticism of
              BiSSE (Binary State Speciation and Extinction) methods.
              Specifically, our model, which we refer to as HiSSE (Hidden State
              Speciation and Extinction), assumes that related to each observed
              state in the model are ``hidden'' states that exhibit potentially
              distinct diversification dynamics and transition rates than the
              observed states in isolation. We also demonstrate how our model
              can be used as character-independent diversification models that
              allow for a complex diversification process that is independent
              of the evolution of a character. Under rigorous simulation tests
              and when applied to empirical data, we find that HiSSE performs
              reasonably well, and can at least detect net diversification rate
              differences between observed and hidden states and detect when
              diversification rate differences do not correlate with the
              observed states. We discuss the remaining issues with
              state-dependent speciation and extinction models in general, and
              the important ways in which HiSSE provides a more nuanced
              understanding of trait-dependent diversification.",

  abstract  = "Abstract The theory of `punctuated equilibrium' hypothesises
               that most morphological change in species takes place in rapid
               bursts triggered by speciation. Eldregde and Gould postulated
               the theory in 1972, as an alternative to the idea that
               morphological change slowly accumulates in the course of time, a
               then common belief they dubbed `phyletic gradualism'. Ever since
               its introduction the theory of punctuated equilibrium has been
               the subject of speculation rather than empirical validation.
               Here I present a method to detect punctuated evolution without
               reference to fossil data, based on the phenotypes of extant
               species and on their relatedness as revealed by molecular
               phylogeny. The method involves a general mathematical model
               describing morphological differentiation of two species over
               time. The two parameters in the model, the rates of punctual
               (cladogenetic) and gradual (anagenetic) change, are estimated
               from plots of morphological diversification against time since
               divergence of extant species.",

              purposes of estimating ancestral states and evaluating character
              independence on specified phylogenies; however, for purposes of
              estimating phylogenies by using discrete morphological data,

              absent in morphological data sets. Without this modification,
              branch lengths are often overestimated, resulting in potentially

               experimental evidence for ecological character displacement in
               adaptive radiation. Sixty?one published cases of character
               displacement involving closely related species (congeners) make
               up the observational data set. All cases involve divergence,
               even though parallel and convergent displacement are
               theoretically possible. Character ratios in sympatry were
               greatest when displacement was symmetric (mean 1.54) and least
               when asymmetric (mean 1.29), perhaps because the most symmetric
               resource distributions are also the broadest. Carnivores are
               vastly overrepresented in the data compared with other trophic
               groups, with herbivores the next most common category. I
               consider five hypotheses to explain this pattern, including the
               possibility that the likelihood of divergence via competition
               depends on position in food webs. Overall, the quality and
               completeness of observational data has improved in recent years,
               as judged by the extent to which individual cases satisfy six
               standard criteria. All but one of the criteria are met in over
               half the cases. Most often lacking is independent evidence that
               the species involved compete for resources. For this reason, we
               cannot be sure that divergence in sympatry is usually the result
               of resource competition rather than some other interaction.
               Field experiments on character displacement, which explore how
               interaction strength changes per unit change in phenotypic
               traits, are only just beginning. I summarize research on
               threespine sticklebacks that used experiments in ponds to test
               three predictions: that present?day differences between
               sympatric species are a ?ghost? of competition past; that adding
               a competitor alters natural selection pressures on a species
               already present, favoring divergence; and that divergent natural
               selection stemming from resource competition is frequency
               dependent. In total, the evidence suggests that character
               displacement occurs frequently in nature, and it probably plays
               an important role in the evolution of diversity in many adaptive
               radiations.",

  abstract = "Parental care shows remarkable variation across the animal
              kingdom, but while maternal and biparental care are common in
              terrestrial organisms, male-only care dominates in aquatic
              species that provide care. Using the most complete phylogenetic
              tree of bony fishes to date, we test whether the opportunity for
              external fertilization in aquatic environments can explain the
              more frequent evolution of male care in this group. We show that
              paternal care has evolved at least 30 times independently in fish
              and is found exclusively in externally fertilizing species. Male
              care is positively associated with pair spawning, suggesting that
              confidence in paternity is an important determinant of the
              evolution of care. Crucially, while female care is constrained by
              other forms of reproductive investment, male care occurs more
              frequently when females invest heavily in gamete production. Our
              results suggest that moving control of fertilization outside of
              the female reproductive tract raises male confidence in parentage
              and increases the potential for paternal care, highlighting that

               the most heavily studied dimensions of macroevolution using
               phylogenies. Here, we present a simple, likelihood-based method
               for comparing the rate of phenotypic evolution for continuous
               characters between trees. Our method is derived from a previous
               approach published by Brian O'Meara and colleagues in 2006. We
               examine the statistical performance of the method and find that
               it suffers from the typical downward bias expected for maximum
               likelihood estimates of the variance, but only for very small
               trees. We find that evolutionary rates are estimated with
               minimal bias for trees of even relatively modest size. We also
               find that type I error rates based on a likelihood-ratio test
               are minimally elevated above the nominal level, even for small
               phylogenies. The type I error rate can be reduced to a level at
               or below its nominal value by substituting a test-statistic
               distribution obtained via simulation under the null hypothesis
               of no difference in evolutionary rate among trees. We discuss
               the consequences of failing to account for uncertainty in the
               estimation of species means or in the phylogeny, and describe
               strategies for taking this uncertainty into consideration during
               estimation. We also identify how our approach is related to
               previous methods for comparing the rate of evolution among
               different clades of a single tree or between different
               phenotypic traits. Finally, we describe how the method can be
               applied to different evolutionary models and to discrete
               characters?options that are already implemented in software.
               Evolutionary biologists continue to be intrigued by changes in
               the tempo of phenotypic evolution across the tree of life. The

              diversification follows a birth-death process where speciation
              and extinction rates may vary with one or more traits that evolve
              under a diffusion model. Speciation and extinction rates may be
              arbitrary functions of the character state, allowing much
              flexibility in testing models of trait-dependent diversification.
              I test the approach using simulated phylogenies and show that a
              known relationship between speciation and a quantitative
              character could be recovered in up to 80\% of the cases on large
              trees (500 species). Consistent with other approaches, detecting
              shifts in diversification due to differences in extinction rates
              was harder than when due to differences in speciation rates.
              Finally, I demonstrate the application of QuaSSE to investigate
              the correlation between body size and diversification in
              primates, concluding that clade-specific differences in
              diversification may be more important than size-dependent
              diversification in shaping the patterns of diversity within this

              phangorn, now offers the possibility of reconstructing
              phylogenies with distance based methods, maximum parsimony or
              maximum likelihood (ML) and performing Hadamard conjugation.
              Extending the general ML framework, this package provides the
              possibility of estimating mixture and partition models.
              Furthermore, phangorn offers several functions for comparing

               analyses of considerable importance, are not implemented in any
               other software. Over the past decade, the popularity of the R

               phylogenetic analyses has soared, particularly in phylogenetic
               comparative biology. There are now numerous packages and methods
               developed for the R environment. In this article, we present
               Rphylip, a new R interface for the PHYLIP package. Functions of
               Rphylip interface seamlessly with all of the major analysis

              Our method is based on a maximum-likelihood framework and uses a

  abstract = "Many of the traits associated with elevated rates of speciation,
              including niche specialization and having small and isolated
              populations, are similarly linked with an elevated risk of
              extinction. This suggests that rapidly speciating lineages may
              also be more extinction prone. Empirical tests of a
              speciation-extinction correlation are rare because assessing
              paleontological extinction rates is difficult. However, the
              modern biodiversity crisis allows us to observe patterns of
              extinction in real time, and if this hypothesis is true then we
              would expect young clades that have recently diversified to have
              high contemporary extinction risk. Here, we examine evolutionary
              patterns of modern extinction risk across over 300 genera within
              one of the most threatened vertebrate classes, the Amphibia.
              Consistent with predictions, rapidly diversifying amphibian
              clades also had a greater share of threatened species. Curiously,
              this pattern is not reflected in other tetrapod classes and may
              reflect a greater propensity to speciate through peripheral
              isolation in amphibians, which is partly supported by a negative
              correlation between diversification rate and mean geographic
              range size. This clustered threat in rapidly diversifying
              amphibian genera means that protecting a small number of species

               children on the same tasks. And when new fossils are found, such
               as those of the tiny humans of Flores, scientists compare these
               remains to other fossils and contemporary humans. Comparison
               provides a way to draw general inferences about the evolution of
               traits and therefore has long been the cornerstone of efforts to
               understand biological and cultural diversity. Individual studies
               of fossilized remains, living species, or human populations are
               the essential units of analysis in a comparative study; bringing

  abstract = "The study of animal communication systems is an important step
              towards gaining greater understanding of the processes
              influencing diversification because signals often play an
              important role in mate choice and can lead to reproductive
              isolation. Signal evolution can be influenced by a diversity of
              factors such as biophysical constraints on the emitter, the
              signalling environment, or selection to avoid heterospecific
              matings. Furthermore, because signals can be costly to produce,
              trade-offs may exist between different types of signals. Here, we
              apply phylogenetic comparative analyses to study the evolution of
              acoustic and visual signals in Asian barbets, a clade of
              non-Passerine, forest-dependent birds. Our results suggest that
              evolution of acoustic and visual signals in barbets is influenced
              by diverse factors, such as morphology and signalling
              environment, suggesting a potential effect of sensory drive. We
              found no trade-offs between visual and acoustic signals. Quite to
              the contrary, more colourful species sing significantly longer
              songs. Song characteristics presented distinct patterns of
              evolution. Song frequency diverged early on and the rate of
              evolution of this trait appears to be constrained by body size.
              On the other hand, characteristics associated with length of the
              song presented evidence for more recent divergence. Finally, our
              results indicate that there is a spatial component to the
              evolution of visual signals, and that visual signals are more
              divergent between closely related taxa than acoustic signals.
              Hence, visual signals in these species could play a role in
              speciation or reinforcement of reproductive isolation following
              secondary contacts.",

              of the method of generalized least squares (GLSs) regression
              under a Brownian motion model of evolution. This equivalence has
              several implications: 1. Understanding the structure of the
              linear model for GLS regression provides insight into when and
              why phylogeny is important in comparative studies. 2. The
              limitations of the PIC regression analysis are the same as the
              limitations of the GLS model. In particular, phylogenetic
              covariance applies only to the response variable in the
              regression and the explanatory variable should be regarded as
              fixed. Calculation of PICs for explanatory variables should be
              treated as a mathematical idiosyncrasy of the PIC regression
              algorithm. 3. Since the GLS estimator is the best linear unbiased
              estimator (BLUE), the slope parameter estimated using PICs is
              also BLUE. 4. If the slope is estimated using different branch
              lengths for the explanatory and response variables in the PIC
              algorithm, the estimator is no longer the BLUE, so this is not
              recommended. Finally, we discuss whether or not and how to

  author   = "Ives, Anthony R",
  abstract = "Many researchers want to report an $R^\{2\}$ to measure the
              variance explained by a model. When the model includes
              correlation among data, such as phylogenetic models and mixed
              models, defining an $R^\{2\}$ faces two conceptual problems. (i)
              It is unclear how to measure the variance explained by predictor
              (independent) variables when the model contains covariances. (ii)
              Researchers may want the $R^\{2\}$ to include the variance
              explained by the covariances by asking questions such as ``How
              much of the data is explained by phylogeny?'' Here, I
              investigated three $R^\{2\}$s for phylogenetic and mixed models.
              $R^\{2\}_\{resid\}$ is an extension of the ordinary least-squares
              $R^\{2\}$ that weights residuals by variances and covariances
              estimated by the model; it is closely related to
              $R^\{2\}_\{glmm\}$ presented by Nakagawa and Schielzeth (2013. A
              general and simple method for obtaining R2 from generalized
              linear mixed-effects models. Methods Ecol. Evol. 4:133-142).
              $R^\{2\}_\{pred\}$ is based on predicting each residual from the
              fitted model and computing the variance between observed and
              predicted values. $R^\{2\}_\{lik\}$ is based on the likelihood of
              fitted models, and therefore, reflects the amount of information
              that the models contain. These three $R^\{2\}$s are formulated as
              partial $R^\{2\}$s, making it possible to compare the
              contributions of predictor variables and variance components
              (phylogenetic signal and random effects) to the fit of models.
              Because partial $R^\{2\}$s compare a full model with a reduced
              model without components of the full model, they are distinct
              from marginal $R^\{2\}$s that partition additive components of
              the variance. I assessed the properties of the $R^\{2\}$s for
              phylogenetic models using simulations for continuous and binary
              response data (phylogenetic generalized least squares and
              phylogenetic logistic regression). Because the $R^\{2\}$s are
              designed broadly for any model for correlated data, I also
              compared $R^\{2\}$s for linear mixed models and generalized
              linear mixed models. $R^\{2\}_\{resid\}$, $R^\{2\}_\{pred\}$, and
              $R^\{2\}_\{lik\}$ all have similar performance in describing the
              variance explained by different components of models. However,
              $R^\{2\}_\{pred\}$ gives the most direct answer to the question
              of how much variance in the data is explained by a model.
              $R^\{2\}_\{resid\}$ is most appropriate for comparing models fit
              to different data sets, because it does not depend on sample
              sizes. And $R^\{2\}_\{lik\}$ is most appropriate to assess the
              importance of different components within the same model applied
              to the same data, because it is most closely associated with
              statistical significance tests.",

              the rate at which bacteria accumulate mutations (accumulation
              rates) in their natural environments over short periods of time.
              We have compiled estimates of the accumulation rate for over 34
              species of bacteria, the majority of which are pathogens evolving
              either within an individual host or during outbreaks. Across
              species, we find that accumulation rates vary by over 3700-fold.
              We investigate whether accumulation rates are associated to a
              number potential correlates including genome size, GC content,
              measures of the natural selection and the time frame over which

  title    = "Testing for phylogenetic signal in comparative data: behavioral
              traits are more labile",
  author   = "Blomberg, Simon P and Garland, Jr, Theodore and Ives, Anthony R",
  abstract = "The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically based
              statistical methods is that phylogenetic signal, the tendency for
              related species to resemble each other, is ubiquitous. Whether
              this assertion is true for a given trait in a given lineage is an
              empirical question, but general tools for detecting and
              quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately developed. We
              present new methods for continuous-valued characters that can be
              implemented with either phylogenetically independent contrasts or
              generalized least-squares models. First, a simple randomization
              procedure allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of
              similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I
              error rate at a nominal alpha = 0.05 and good power (0.8) for
              simulated datasets with 20 or more species. Second, we derive a
              descriptive statistic, K, which allows valid comparisons of the
              amount of phylogenetic signal across traits and trees. Third, we
              provide two biologically motivated branch-length transformations,
              one based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model of stabilizing
              selection, the other based on a new model in which character
              evolution can accelerate or decelerate (ACDC) in rate (e.g., as
              may occur during or after an adaptive radiation). Maximum
              likelihood estimation of the OU (d) and ACDC (g) parameters can
              serve as tests for phylogenetic signal because an estimate of d
              or g near zero implies that a phylogeny with little hierarchical
              structure (a star) offers a good fit to the data. Transformations
              that improve the fit of a tree to comparative data will increase
              power to detect phylogenetic signal and may also be preferable
              for further comparative analyses, such as of correlated character
              evolution. Application of the methods to data from the literature
              revealed that, for trees with 20 or more species, 92\% of traits
              exhibited significant phylogenetic signal (randomization test),
              including behavioral and ecological ones that are thought to be
              relatively evolutionarily malleable (e.g., highly adaptive)
              and/or subject to relatively strong environmental (nongenetic)
              effects or high levels of measurement error. Irrespective of
              sample size, most traits (but not body size, on average) showed
              less signal than expected given the topology, branch lengths, and
              a Brownian motion model of evolution (i.e., K was less than one),
              which may be attributed to adaptation and/or measurement error in
              the broad sense (including errors in estimates of phenotypes,
              branch lengths, and topology). Analysis of variance of log K for
              all 121 traits (from 35 trees) indicated that behavioral traits
              exhibit lower signal than body size, morphological, life-history,
              or physiological traits. In addition, physiological traits
              (corrected for body size) showed less signal than did body size
              itself. For trees with 20 or more species, the estimated OU (25\%
              of traits) and/or ACDC (40\%) transformation parameter differed

  author   = "Butler, Marguerite A and King, Aaron A",
  abstract = "Biologists employ phylogenetic comparative methods to study
              adaptive evolution. However, none of the popular methods model
              selection directly. We explain and develop a method based on the
              Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, first proposed by Hansen.
              Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models incorporate both selection and drift
              and are thus qualitatively different from, and more general than,
              pure drift models based on Brownian motion. Most importantly, OU
              models possess selective optima that formalize the notion of
              adaptive zone. In this article, we develop the method for one
              quantitative character, discuss interpretations of its
              parameters, and provide code implementing the method. Our
              approach allows us to translate hypotheses regarding adaptation
              in different selective regimes into explicit models, to test the
              models against data using maximum-likelihood-based model
              selection techniques, and to infer details of the evolutionary
              process. We illustrate the method using two worked examples.
              Relative to existing approaches, the direct modeling approach we
              demonstrate allows one to explore more detailed hypotheses and to
              utilize more of the information content of comparative data sets
              than existing methods. Moreover, the use of a model selection
              framework to simultaneously compare a variety of hypotheses
              advances our ability to assess alternative evolutionary
              explanations.",

              models have proved useful in a variety of contexts, they still do
              not cover all the scenarios biologists want to examine. For
              models based on the OU process, model complexity is restricted in

              variation among species because differences in form underlie
              variation in functional performance of ecological tasks like
              capturing prey, avoiding predators, or defending territories.
              However, many functions have complex morphological bases that can
              weaken associations between morphological and functional
              diversification. We investigate the link between these levels of
              diversity in a mechanically explicit model of fish
              suction-feeding performance, where the map of head morphology to
              feeding mechanics is many-to-one: multiple, alternative forms can
              produce the same mechanical property. We show that many-to-one
              mapping leads to discordance between morphological and mechanical
              diversity in the freshwater fish family, the Centrarchidae,
              despite close associations between morphological changes and
              their mechanical effects. We find that each of the model's five
              morphological variables underlies evolution of suction capacity.
              Yet, the major centrarchid clades exhibit an order of magnitude
              range in diversity of suction mechanics in the absence of any
              clear difference in diversity of the morphological variables.
              This cryptic pattern of mechanical diversity suggests an
              evolutionary history for suction performance that is unlike the
              one inferred from comparisons of morphological diversity. Because
              many-to-one mapping is likely to be common in functional systems,
              this property of design may lead to widespread discordance
              between functional and morphological diversity. Although we focus
              on the interaction between morphology and mechanics, many-to-one

              immature at the time they are dispersed as pollen, but
              approximately 30\% of flowering plants have tricellular pollen
              containing fully formed sperm at anthesis. The classic study of
              Brewbaker (1967: American Journal of Botany 54: 1069-1083)
              provided a powerful confirmation of the long-standing hypothesis
              that tricellular pollen had many parallel and irreversible
              origins within angiosperms. We readdressed the main questions of
              that study with modern comparative phylogenetic methods. METHODS:
              We used our own and more recent reports to greatly expand the
              Brewbaker data set. We modeled trait evolution for 2511 species
              on a time-calibrated angiosperm phylogeny using (1) Binary State
              Speciation and Extinction (BiSSE), which accounts for the effect
              of species diversification rates on character transition rates
              and, (2) the hidden rates model (HRM), which incorporates
              variation in transition rates across a phylogeny. KEY RESULTS:
              Seventy percent of species had bicellular pollen. BiSSE found a
              1.9-fold higher bicellular to tricellular transition rate than in
              the reverse direction, and bicellular lineages had a 1.8-fold
              higher diversification rate than tricellular lineages. HRM found
              heterogeneity in evolutionary rates, with bidirectional
              transition rates in three of four rate classes. CONCLUSIONS: The
              tricellular condition is not irreversible. Pollen cell numbers
              are maintained at intermediate frequencies because lower net
              diversification rates of tricellular lineages are counterbalanced
              by slower state shifts to the bicellular condition. That
              tricellular lineages diversify slowly and give rise to bicellular
              lineages slowly reflects a linkage between the evolution of
              sporophyte lifestyles and the developmental lability of male
              gametophytes.",

  abstract = "The planarian suborder Cavernicola Sluys, 1990 was originally
              created to house five species of triclad flatworms with special
              morphological features and a surprisingly discontinuous and broad
              geographic distribution. These five species could not be
              accommodated with any degree of certainty in any of the three
              taxonomic groups existing at that moment, viz., Paludicola
              Hallez, 1892, Terricola Hallez, 1892, and Maricola Hallez, 1892.
              The scarce representation of the group and the peculiarities of
              the morphological features of the species, including several
              described more recently, have complicated new tests of the
              monophyly of the Cavernicola, the assessment of its taxonomic
              status, as well as the resolution of its internal relationships.
              Here we present the first molecular study including all genera
              currently known for the group, excepting one. We analysed newly
              generated 18S and 28S rDNA data for these species, together with
              a broad representation of other triclad flatworms. The resulting
              phylogenetic trees supported the monophyly of the Cavernicola, as
              well as its sister-group relationship to the Maricola. The
              sister-group relationship to the Maricola and affinities within
              the Cavernicola falsify the morphology-based phylogeny of the
              latter that was proposed previously. The relatively high
              diversity of some cavernicolan genera suggests that the presumed
              rarity of the group actually may in part be due to a collecting
              artefact. Ancestral state reconstruction analyses suggest that
              the ancestral habitat of the group concerned epigean freshwater
              conditions. Our results point to an evolutionary scenario in
              which the Cavernicola (a) originated in a freshwater habitat, (b)
              as the sister clade of the marine triclads, and (c) subsequently
              radiated and colonized both epigean and hypogean environments.
              Competition with other planarians, notably members of the
              Continenticola, or changes in epigean habitat conditions are two
              possible explanations -still to be tested- for the loss of most
              epigean diversity of the Cavernicola, which is currently
              reflected in their highly disjunct distributions.",

  abstract = "Many methods are available for estimating ancestral values of
              continuous characteristics, but little is known about how well
              these methods perform. Here we compare six methods: linear
              parsimony, squared-change parsimony, one-parameter maximum
              likelihood (Brownian motion), two-parameter maximum likelihood
              (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process), and independent comparisons with
              and without branch-length information. We apply these methods to
              data from 20 morphospecies of Pleistocene planktic Foraminifera
              in order to estimate ancestral size and shape variables, and
              compare these estimates with measurements on fossils close to the
              phylogenetic position of 13 ancestors. No method produced
              accurate estimates for any variable: estimates were consistently
              less good as predictors of the observed values than were the
              averages of the observed values. The two-parameter
              maximum-likelihood model consistently produces the most accurate
              size estimates overall. Estimation of ancestral sizes is
              confounded by an evolutionary trend towards increasing size.
              Shape showed no trend but was still estimated very poorly: we
              consider possible reasons. We discuss the implications of our

               and beyond",
  author    = "Hunt, Gene",
  abstract  = "For almost 30 years, paleontologists have analyzed evolutionary
               sequences in terms of simple null models, most commonly random
               walks. Despite this long history, there has been little
               discussion of how model parameters may be estimated from real
               paleontological data. In this paper, I outline a
               likelihood-based framework for fitting and comparing models of
               phyletic evolution. Because of its usefulness and historical
               importance, I focus on a general form of the random walk model.
               The long-term dynamics of this model depend on just two
               parameters: the mean ($\mu$step) and variance ($\sigma$2step) of
               the distribution of evolutionary transitions (or ``steps''). The
               value of $\mu$step determines the directionality of a sequence,
               and $\sigma$2step governs its volatility. Simulations show that
               these two parameters can be inferred reliably from
               paleontological data regardless of how completely the evolving
               lineage is sampled.In addition to random walk models, suitable
               modification of the likelihood function permits consideration of
               a wide range of alternative evolutionary models. Candidate
               evolutionary models may be compared on equal footing using
               information statistics such as the Akaike Information Criterion
               (AIC). Two extensions to this method are developed: modeling
               stasis as an evolutionary mode, and assessing the homogeneity of
               dynamics across multiple evolutionary sequences. Within this
               framework, I reanalyze two well-known published data sets: tooth
               measurements from the Eocene mammal Cantius, and shell shape in
               the planktonic foraminifera Contusotruncana. These analyses
               support previous interpretations about evolutionary mode in size
               and shape variables in Cantius, and confirm the significantly
               directional nature of shell shape evolution in Contusotruncana.
               In addition, this model-fitting approach leads to a further
               insight about the geographic structure of evolutionary change in
               this foraminiferan lineage.",

              the most apical branches in the Tree of Life through exploration
              of the phylogenetic relationships of darters, a species-rich
              clade of North American freshwater fishes. With a near-complete
              taxon sampling of close to 250 species, we aim to investigate
              strategies for efficient multilocus data sampling and the
              estimation of divergence times using relaxed-clock methods when a
              clade lacks a fossil record. Our phylogenetic data set comprises
              a single mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene and two nuclear genes
              sampled from 245 of the 248 darter species. This dense sampling
              allows us to determine if a modest amount of nuclear DNA sequence
              data can resolve relationships among closely related animal
              species. Darters lack a fossil record to provide age calibration
              priors in relaxed-clock analyses. Therefore, we use a
              near-complete species-sampled phylogeny of the perciform clade
              Centrarchidae, which has a rich fossil record, to assess two
              distinct strategies of external calibration in relaxed-clock
              divergence time estimates of darters: using ages inferred from
              the fossil record and molecular evolutionary rate estimates.
              Comparison of Bayesian phylogenies inferred from mtDNA and
              nuclear genes reveals that heterospecific mtDNA is present in
              approximately 12.5\% of all darter species. We identify three

              transfer, which involves the transfer of mtDNA among extant and
              sympatric darter species, indeterminate introgression, which
              involves the transfer of mtDNA from a lineage that cannot be
              confidently identified because the introgressed haplotypes are
              not clearly referable to mtDNA haplotypes in any recognized
              species, and deep introgression, which is characterized by
              species diversification within a recipient clade subsequent to
              the transfer of heterospecific mtDNA. The results of our analyses
              indicate that DNA sequences sampled from single-copy nuclear
              genes can provide appreciable phylogenetic resolution for closely
              related animal species. A well-resolved near-complete
              species-sampled phylogeny of darters was estimated with Bayesian
              methods using a concatenated mtDNA and nuclear gene data set with
              all identified heterospecific mtDNA haplotypes treated as missing
              data. The relaxed-clock analyses resulted in very similar
              posterior age estimates across the three sampled genes and
              methods of calibration and therefore offer a viable strategy for
              estimating divergence times for clades that lack a fossil record.
              In addition, an informative rank-free clade-based classification
              of darters that preserves the rich history of nomenclature in the
              group and provides formal taxonomic communication of darter
              clades was constructed using the mtDNA and nuclear gene
              phylogeny. On the whole, the appeal of mtDNA for phylogeny
              inference among closely related animal species is diminished by
              the observations of extensive mtDNA introgression and by finding
              appreciable phylogenetic signal in a modest sampling of nuclear
              genes in our phylogenetic analyses of darters.",

              enable broad-scale estimation of species diversification. These
              now common approaches typically are characterized by (1)
              incomplete species coverage without explicit sampling
              methodologies and/or (2) sparse backbone representation, and
              usually rely on presumed phylogenetic placements to account for
              species without molecular data. We used empirical examples to
              examine the effects of incomplete sampling on diversification
              estimation and provide constructive suggestions to ecologists and
              evolutionary biologists based on those results. METHODS: We used
              a supermatrix for rosids and one well-sampled subclade
              (Cucurbitaceae) as empirical case studies. We compared results
              using these large phylogenies with those based on a previously
              inferred, smaller supermatrix and on a synthetic tree resource
              with complete taxonomic coverage. Finally, we simulated random
              and representative taxon sampling and explored the impact of
              sampling on three commonly used methods, both parametric (RPANDA
              and BAMM) and semiparametric (DR). RESULTS: We found that the
              impact of sampling on diversification estimates was idiosyncratic
              and often strong. Compared to full empirical sampling,
              representative and random sampling schemes either depressed or
              inflated speciation rates, depending on methods and sampling
              schemes. No method was entirely robust to poor sampling, but BAMM
              was least sensitive to moderate levels of missing taxa.
              CONCLUSIONS: We suggest caution against uncritical modeling of
              missing taxa using taxonomic data for poorly sampled trees and in
              the use of summary backbone trees and other data sets with high

              possibly arising from constraints in the availability of space,
              resources, or ecological niches. Under this hypothesis,
              speciation rates decay over time and biodiversity eventually
              saturates, with new species emerging only when others are driven
              to extinction. This view of macro-evolution contradicts an
              alternative hypothesis that biodiversity is unbounded, with
              species ever accumulating as they find new niches to occupy.
              These contrasting theories of biodiversity dynamics yield
              fundamentally different explanations for the disparity in species
              richness across taxa and regions. Here, we test whether
              speciation rates have decayed or remained constant over time, and
              whether biodiversity is saturated or still expanding. We first
              derive a general likelihood expression for internode distances in
              a phylogeny, based on the well-known coalescent process from
              population genetics. This expression accounts for either
              time-constant or time-variable rates, time-constant or
              time-variable diversity, and completely or incompletely sampled

              representing amphibians, arthropods, birds, mammals, mollusks,
              and flowering plants. Our results indicate that speciation rates
              typically decay over time, but that diversity is still expanding
              at present. The evidence for expanding-diversity models suggests

              and model-based phylogenetic comparative methods for
              macroevolutionary analyses. The model-free approaches implemented
              in RPANDA are recently developed approaches stemming from graph
              theory that allow summarizing the information contained in
              phylogenetic trees, computing distances between trees, and
              clustering them accordingly. They also allow identifying distinct
              branching patterns within single trees. RPANDA also implements
              likelihood-based models for fitting various diversification
              models to phylogenetic trees. It includes birth?death models with
              i) constant, ii) time-dependent and iii) environmental-dependent
              speciation and extinction rates. It also includes models with
              equilibrium diversity derived from the coalescent process, as
              well as a likelihood-based inference framework to fit the
              individual-based model of Speciation by Genetic Differentiation,
              which is an extension of Hubbell's neutral theory of
              biodiversity. RPANDA can be used to (i) characterize trees by
              plotting their spectral density profiles (ii) compare trees and
              cluster them according to their similarities, (iii) identify and
              plot distinct branching patterns within trees, (iv) compare the
              fit of alternative diversification models to phylogenetic trees,
              (v) estimate rates of speciation and extinction, (vi) estimate
              and plot how these rates have varied with time and environmental
              variables and (vii) deduce and plot estimates of species richness
              through geological time. RPANDA provides investigators with a set
              of tools for exploring patterns in phylogenetic trees and fitting
              various models to these trees, thereby contributing to the
              ongoing development of phylogenetics in the life sciences.",

              species-rich, winged insect groups contain flightless lineages.
              The loss of flight may promote allopatric differentiation due to
              limited dispersal power and may result in a high speciation rate
              in the flightless lineage. Here we show that loss of flight
              accelerates allopatric speciation using carrion beetles

              flight-capable species, and that the speciation rate with the
              flightless state is twice that with the flight-capable state.
              Moreover, a meta-analysis of 51 beetle species from 15 families

              ecosystems found in tropical (coral reefs) and temperate zones
              (rocky reefs) that harbor exceptional levels of biodiversity. We
              investigated whether reef habitats promote the evolution of
              morphological diversity in the feeding and locomotion systems of
              grunts (Haemulidae), a group of predominantly nocturnal fishes

              history of reef living, we demonstrate that rates of
              morphological evolution are faster in reef-dwelling haemulids.
              The magnitude of this effect depends on the type of trait; on
              average, traits involved in the functional systems for prey
              capture and processing evolve twice as fast on reefs as locomotor

              fine-scale trophic niche partitioning and character displacement

              methods for explicitly modeling the relationships among character
              states, speciation rates, and extinction rates on phylogenetic
              trees- BiSSE, QuaSSE, GeoSSE, and related models-have been widely

              with which neutral traits are inferred to have statistically
              significant associations with speciation rate. We first
              demonstrate this unfortunate effect for a known model assumption
              violation: shifts in speciation rate associated with a character
              not included in the model. We further show that for many

              state-dependent diversification exhibit an even higher Type I
              error rate, indicating that the method is susceptible to
              additional, unknown model inadequacies. For traits that evolve

              does not require replicated shifts in character state and

              state and speciation rate arise even for traits that lack

              pseudoreplication alone cannot fully explain the problem. The

               are they so diverse? Most herbivorous insects feed on few plant
               species, and adaptive host specialization is often invoked to
               explain their diversification. Nevertheless, it is possible that
               the narrow host ranges of many herbivorous insects are
               nonadaptive. Here, we test predictions of this hypothesis with
               comparative phylogenetic analyses of scale insects, a group for
               which there appear to be few host-use trade-offs that would
               select against polyphagy, and for which passive wind-dispersal
               should make host specificity costly. We infer a strong positive
               relationship between host range and diversification rate, and a
               marked asymmetry in cladogenetic changes in diet breadth. These
               results are consonant with a system of pervasive nonadaptive

              comprise three robust and well-supported clades that do not
              correspond to current taxonomy. One of these clades comprises B.
              fasciatus from the Lau group of Fiji and Tonga (type locality for
              B. fasciatus), while a second comprises putative B. fasciatus
              from the central regions of Fiji, which we refer to here as B. n.
              sp. Animals in this clade form the sister group to B. vitiensis

              a new species of Brachylophus based on molecular and
              morphological data. With only one exception, every island is home
              to one or more unique haplotypes. We discuss alternative

               integrating phylogenetic information into studies of community
               organization: 1. examining the phylogenetic structure of
               community assemblages, 2. exploring the phylogenetic basis of
               community niche structure, and 3. adding a community context to

               character and highlight the challenges of using phylogenies of
               partial lineages. We also review phylogenetic approaches to

              reconstructing the evolution of geographic ranges on phylogenetic
              trees are poorly developed relative to the diversity of analogous
              methods available for inferring character evolution. We attempt
              to rectify this deficiency by constructing a
              dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) model for geographic
              range evolution that specifies instantaneous transition rates
              between discrete states (ranges) along phylogenetic branches and
              apply it to estimating likelihoods of ancestral states (range
              inheritance scenarios) at cladogenesis events. Unlike an earlier
              version of this approach, the present model allows for an
              analytical solution to probabilities of range transitions as a
              function of time, enabling free parameters in the model, rates of
              dispersal, and local extinction to be estimated by maximum
              likelihood. Simulation results indicate that accurate parameter
              estimates may be difficult to obtain in practice but also show
              that ancestral range inheritance scenarios nevertheless can be
              correctly recovered with high success if rates of range evolution
              are low relative to the rate of cladogenesis. We apply the DEC
              model to a previously published, exemplary case study of island
              biogeography involving Hawaiian endemic angiosperms in Psychotria
              (Rubiaceae), showing how the DEC model can be iteratively refined

              geological constraints involving times of island origin may be
              imposed on the likelihood function. The DEC model is sufficiently
              similar to character models that it might serve as a gateway
              through which many existing comparative methods for characters
              could be imported into the realm of historical biogeography;
              moreover, it might also inspire the conceptual expansion of
              character models toward inclusion of evolutionary change as
              directly coincident, either as cause or consequence, with
              cladogenesis events. The DEC model is thus an incremental advance

              describe a likelihood framework for inferring the evolution of

              local extinction in a set of discrete areas as stochastic events
              in continuous time. Unlike existing methods for estimating
              ancestral areas, such as dispersal-vicariance analysis, this
              approach incorporates information on the timing of both lineage
              divergences and the availability of connections between areas
              (dispersal routes). Monte Carlo methods are used to estimate
              branch-specific transition probabilities for geographic ranges,

              importance is disputed within the vicariance school.
              Probabilistic modeling of geographic range evolution creates the
              potential to test different biogeographical models against data
              using standard statistical model choice procedures, as long as
              multiple models are available. I re-implement the
              Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis (DEC) model of LAGRANGE in the
              R package BioGeoBEARS, and modify it to create a new model, DEC +
              J, which adds founder-event speciation, the importance of which
              is governed by a new free parameter, [Formula: see text]. The
              identifiability of DEC and DEC + J is tested on data sets
              simulated under a wide range of macroevolutionary models where
              geography evolves jointly with lineage birth/death events. The
              results confirm that DEC and DEC + J are identifiable even though
              these models ignore the fact that molecular phylogenies are
              missing many cladogenesis and extinction events. The simulations
              also indicate that DEC will have substantially increased errors

              occupying only one island, rather than the widespread ancestors
              often favored by DEC. These results indicate that the assumptions

              increasingly using statistical model selection methods to choose
              among variants of the dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC)
              model, especially between DEC and DEC+J, a variant that
              emphasizes ?jump dispersal,? or founder-event speciation, as a
              type of cladogenetic range inheritance scenario. Unfortunately,
              DEC+J is a poor model of founder-event speciation, and
              statistical comparisons of its likelihood with DEC are
              inappropriate. DEC and DEC+J share a conceptual flaw:
              cladogenetic events of range inheritance at ancestral nodes,
              unlike anagenetic events of dispersal and local extinction along
              branches, are not modelled as being probabilistic with respect to
              time. Ignoring this probability factor artificially inflates the
              contribution of cladogenetic events to the likelihood, and leads
              to underestimates of anagenetic, time-dependent range evolution.
              The flaw is exacerbated in DEC+J because not only is jump
              dispersal allowed, expanding the set of cladogenetic events, its
              probability relative to non-jump events is assigned a free
              parameter, j, that when maximized precludes the possibility of
              non-jump events at ancestral nodes. DEC+J thus parameterizes the
              mode of speciation, but like DEC, it does not parameterize the
              rate of speciation. This inconsistency has undesirable
              consequences, such as a greater tendency towards degenerate
              inferences in which the data are explained entirely by
              cladogenetic events (at which point branch lengths become
              irrelevant, with estimated anagenetic rates of 0). Inferences
              with DEC+J can in some cases depart dramatically from intuition,
              e.g. when highly unparsimonious numbers of jump dispersal events
              are required solely because j is maximized. Statistical
              comparison with DEC is inappropriate because a higher DEC+J
              likelihood does not reflect a more close approximation of the
              ?true? model of range evolution, which surely must include
              time-dependent processes; instead, it is simply due to more
              weight being allocated (via j) to jump dispersal events whose
              time-dependent probabilities are ignored. In testing hypotheses
              about the geographic mode of speciation, jump dispersal can and
              should instead be modelled using existing frameworks for
              state-dependent lineage diversification in continuous time,
              taking appropriate cautions against Type I errors associated with
              such methods. For simple inference of ancestral ranges on a fixed
              phylogeny, a DEC-based model may be defensible if statistical
              model selection is not used to justify the choice, and it is
              understood that inferences about cladogenetic range inheritance
              lack any relation to time, normally a fundamental axis of
              evolutionary models.",

              photographs of 184 anole species from across the genus'
              geographical range. We use phylogenetic comparative methods to
              test two hypotheses: that larger dewlaps are associated with
              higher speciation rates, and that relative dewlap area
              diversifies according to a speciational model of evolution. We
              find no evidence of trait-dependent speciation, indicating that
              larger signals do not enhance any role the dewlap has in
              promoting speciation. Instead, we find a signal of mixed
              speciational and gradual trait evolution, with a particularly
              strong signal of speciational change in the dewlaps of mainland
              lineages. This indicates that dewlap size diversifies in
              association with the speciation process, suggesting that

  abstract = "Evolutionary biology is a study of life's history on Earth. In
              researching this history, biologists are often interested in
              attempting to reconstruct phenotypes for the long extinct
              ancestors of living species. Various methods have been developed
              to do this on a phylogeny from the data for extant taxa. In the
              present article, I introduce a new approach for ancestral
              character estimation for discretely valued traits. This approach
              is based on the threshold model from evolutionary quantitative
              genetics. Under the threshold model, the value exhibited by an
              individual or species for a discrete character is determined by
              an underlying, unobserved continuous trait called ``liability.''
              In this new method for ancestral state reconstruction, I use
              Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample the
              liabilities of ancestral and tip species, and the relative
              positions of two or more thresholds, from their joint posterior
              probability distribution. Using data simulated under the model, I
              find that the method has very good performance in ancestral
              character estimation. Use of the threshold model for ancestral
              state reconstruction relies on a priori specification of the
              order of the discrete character states along the liability axis.
              I test the use of a Bayesian MCMC information theoretic criterion
              based approach to choose among different hypothesized orderings
              for the discrete character. Finally, I apply the method to the

  abstract = "Molecular phylogenies are a key source of information about the
              tempo and mode of species diversification. However, most
              empirical phylogenies do not contain representatives of all
              species, such that diversification rates are typically estimated
              from incompletely sampled data. Most researchers recognize that
              incomplete sampling can lead to biased rate estimates, but the
              statistical properties of methods for accommodating incomplete
              sampling remain poorly known. In this point of view, we
              demonstrate theoretical concerns with the widespread use of
              analytical sampling corrections for sparsely sampled phylogenies
              of higher taxonomic groups. In particular, corrections based on
              ``sampling fractions'' can lead to low statistical power to infer
              rate variation when it is present, depending on the likelihood
              function used for inference. In the extreme, the sampling
              fraction correction can lead to spurious patterns of
              diversification that are driven solely by unbalanced sampling
              across the tree in concert with low overall power to infer
              shifts. Stochastic polytomy resolution provides an alternative to
              sampling fraction approaches that avoids some of these biases. We
              show that stochastic polytomy resolvers can greatly improve the
              power of common analyses to estimate shifts in diversification
              rates. We introduce a new stochastic polytomy resolution method

              other large geographic regions remains one of the most
              challenging problems at the intersection of ecology and
              evolution. Here we argue that empirical evidence supports a model
              whereby ecological factors associated with resource availability
              regulate species richness at continental scales. Any large-scale
              predictive model for biological diversity must explain three
              robust patterns in the natural world. First, species richness for
              evolutionary biotas is highly correlated with resource-associated
              surrogate variables, including area, temperature, and
              productivity. Second, species richness across epochal timescales
              is largely stationary in time. Third, the dynamics of diversity
              exhibit clear and predictable responses to mass extinctions, key
              innovations, and other perturbations. Collectively, these
              patterns are readily explained by a model in which species
              richness is regulated by diversity-dependent feedback mechanisms.
              We argue that many purported tests of the ecological limits
              hypothesis, including branching patterns in molecular
              phylogenies, are inherently weak and distract from these three
              core patterns. We have much to learn about the complex hierarchy

  abstract = "In this article we propose a new framework for studying adaptive
              radiations in the context of diversity-dependent diversification.
              Diversity dependence causes diversification to decelerate at the
              end of an adaptive radiation but also plays a key role in the
              initial pulse of diversification. In particular, key innovations
              (which in our definition include novel traits as well as new
              environments) may cause decoupling of the diversity-dependent
              dynamics of the innovative clade from the diversity-dependent
              dynamics of its ancestral clade. We present a likelihood-based
              inference method to test for decoupling of diversity dependence
              using molecular phylogenies. The method, which can handle
              incomplete phylogenies, identifies when the decoupling took place
              and which diversification parameters are affected. We illustrate
              our approach by applying it to the molecular phylogeny of the
              North American clade of the legume tribe Psoraleeae (47 extant
              species, of which 4 are missing). Two diversification rate shifts
              were previously identified for this clade; our analysis shows
              that the first, positive shift can be associated with decoupling
              of two Pediomelum subgenera from the other Psoraleeae lineages,
              while we argue that the second, negative shift can be attributed
              to speciation being protracted. The latter explanation yields
              nonzero extinction rates, in contrast to previous findings. Our
              framework offers a new perspective on macroevolution: new

              model instead predicts a constant or accelerating increase in the

              present. The observed slowdown has been attributed to
              nonconstancy of the speciation and extinction rates due to some

  abstract = "Summary Slowdowns in lineage accumulation in phylogenies suggest
              that speciation rates decline as diversity increases. Likelihood
              methods have been developed to detect such diversity dependence.
              However, a thorough test of whether such approaches correctly
              infer diversity dependence is lacking. Here, we simulate
              phylogenetic branching under linear negative diversity?dependent
              and diversity?independent models and estimate from the simulated
              phylogenies the maximum?likelihood parameters for three different
              conditionings ? on survival of the birth?death process given the
              crown age, on tree size (N) and on tree size given the crown age.
              We report the accuracy of recovering the simulation parameters
              and the reliability of the model selection based on the ?2
              likelihood ratio test. Parameter estimate accuracy: Conditioning
              on survival given the crown age yields a severe bias of the
              carrying capacity K towards N and an upward bias of the
              speciation rate, particularly in clades where diversity?dependent
              feedbacks are still weak (N « K). Conditioning on N yields an
              overestimate of K and an underestimate of speciation rate,
              particularly when saturation has been reached. Dual conditioning
              yields relatively unbiased parameter estimates on average, but
              the deviation from the true value for any single estimate may be
              large. Model selection reliability: The frequency of incorrectly
              rejecting a diversity?independent model when the simulation was
              diversity?independent (type I error) differs substantially from
              the significance level $\alpha$ used in the likelihood ratio
              test, rendering the likelihood ratio test inappropriate. The
              frequency of correctly rejecting the diversity?independent model
              when the simulation was diversity?dependent (power) is larger
              when the clade is closer to equilibrium and for conditioning on
              crown age. We conclude that conditioning on crown age has the
              best statistical properties overall, but caution that parameter
              estimates may be biased. To assess parameter uncertainty in
              future studies of diversity dependence on real data, we recommend
              parametric bootstrapping, examination of the likelihood surface
              and comparison of estimates across the types of conditioning. To
              assess model selection reliability, we discourage the use of the
              ?2 likelihood ratio test or AIC (which are equivalent in this
              case), but recommend a likelihood ratio test based on parametric

               two-state (binary) character under a simple model of evolution

  abstract = "Summary We present an r package, ggtree, which provides
              programmable visualization and annotation of phylogenetic trees.
              ggtree can read more tree file formats than other softwares,
              including newick, nexus, NHX, phylip and jplace formats, and
              support visualization of phylo, multiphylo, phylo4, phylo4d,
              obkdata and phyloseq tree objects defined in other r packages. It
              can also extract the tree/branch/node-specific and other data
              from the analysis outputs of beast, epa, hyphy, paml, phylodog,
              pplacer, r8s, raxml and revbayes software, and allows using these
              data to annotate the tree. The package allows colouring and
              annotation of a tree by numerical/categorical node attributes,
              manipulating a tree by rotating, collapsing and zooming out
              clades, highlighting user selected clades or operational
              taxonomic units and exploration of a large tree by zooming into a
              selected portion. A two-dimensional tree can be drawn by scaling
              the tree width based on an attribute of the nodes. A tree can be
              annotated with an associated numerical matrix (as a heat map),
              multiple sequence alignment, subplots or silhouette images. The
              package ggtree is released under the artistic-2.0 license. The

  author   = "Yu, Guangchuang",
  abstract = "Abstract Ggtree is an R/Bioconductor package for visualizing
              tree-like structures and associated data. After 5 years of
              continual development, ggtree has been evolved as a package suite
              that contains treeio for tree data input and output, tidytree for
              tree data manipulation, and ggtree for tree data visualization.
              Ggtree was originally designed to work with phylogenetic trees,
              and has been expanded to support other tree-like structures,
              which extends the application of ggtree to present tree data in
              other disciplines. This article contains five basic protocols
              describing how to visualize trees using the grammar of graphics
              syntax, how to visualize hierarchical clustering results with
              associated data, how to estimate bootstrap values and visualize
              the values on the tree, how to estimate continuous and discrete
              ancestral traits and visualize ancestral states on the tree, and

  abstract = "Abstract Aim Darwin posed a conundrum about species invasions,
              postulating the importance of functional distinctiveness from the
              receiving native community to avoid competition, and, at the same
              time, the importance of shared similarity to pass environmental
              filters and successfully establish. Using phylogenetic distances
              and functional traits, we assessed this conundrum in the flora of
              80 mostly uninhabited islands, where over 30\% of the species are
              invasive. We highlight the importance of publicly available
              datasets to disentangle ecological processes that may drive
              invasion. Location San Juan Islands archipelago, Pacific
              Northwest of North America. Methods Using a supermatrix approach,
              we inferred a maximum-likelihood estimate of the mega-phylogeny
              for the vascular plants on the San Juan Islands. We gathered
              measurements for five ecologically relevant functional traits ?
              seed mass, maximum height, specific leaf area, leaf size and leaf
              nitrogen content. We assessed phylogenetic and functional trait
              similarity between invasive species and the receiving native
              community, and tested the significance of the observed patterns
              against a randomly generated invading community. Results Invasive
              species were more closely related (phylogenetically clustered) to
              their nearest native than natives were on 40 of the islands and
              were more clustered than any random invasive in the species pool
              on 22 islands. Despite phylogenetic similarity, functional traits
              differed between the two status groups, at least for maximum
              height and specific leaf area. When comparing functional
              differences between phylogenetically close relatives, more
              complex patterns emerge. Main conclusion Only with the
              combination of both evolutionary history and phenotypic traits
              were we able to discover support for both sides of Darwin's
              conundrum ? although invasive species have phylogenetically close
              native relatives, functional traits differ between the two status
              groups. This implies that both environmental filtering and
              competitive interactions may be important for invasion success in
              this archipelago.",

  abstract  = "Classic questions about trait evolution-including the
               directionality of character change and its interactions with
               lineage diversification-intersect in the study of plant breeding
               systems. Transitions from self-incompatibility to
               self-compatibility are frequent, and they may proceed within a
               species (``anagenetic'' mode of breeding system change) or in
               conjunction with speciation events (``cladogenetic'' mode of
               change). We apply a recently developed phylogenetic model to the
               nightshade family Solanaceae, quantifying the relative
               contributions of these two modes of evolution along with the
               tempo of breeding system change, speciation, and extinction. We
               find that self-incompatibility, a genetic mechanism that
               prevents self-fertilization, is lost largely by the cladogenetic
               mode. Self-compatible species are thus more likely to arise from
               the isolation of a newly self-compatible population than from
               species-wide fixation of self-compatible mutants. Shared
               polymorphism at the locus that governs self-incompatibility
               shows it to be ancestral and not regained within this family. We
               demonstrate that failing to account for cladogenetic character
               change misleads phylogenetic tests of evolutionary
               irreversibility, both for breeding system in Solanaceae and on
               simulated trees.",
