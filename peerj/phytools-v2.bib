              out by invalid statistical methods. Most regression, correlation,
              and contingency table methods, including nonparametric methods,
              assume that the points are drawn independently from a common
              distribution. When species are taken from a branching phylogeny,
              they are manifestly nonindependent. Use of a statistical method
              that assumes independence will cause overstatement of the
              significance in hypothesis tests. Some illustrative examples of
              these phenomena have been given, and limitations of previous
              proposals of ways to correct for the nonindependence have been
              discussed. A method of correcting for the phylogeny has been
              proposed. It requires that we know both the tree topology and the
              branch lengths, and that we be willing to allow the characters to
              be modeled by Brownian motion on a linear scale. Given these
              conditions, the phylogeny specifies a set of contrasts among
              species, contrasts that are statistically independent and can be
              used in regression or correlation studies. The considerable
              barriers to making practical use of this technique have been

              purposes of estimating ancestral states and evaluating character
              independence on specified phylogenies; however, for purposes of
              estimating phylogenies by using discrete morphological data,

              the possibility of using standard, well-behaved Markov models for
              estimating morphological phylogenies (including branch lengths)

               The method assesses whether a pattern of association across the

               characters. The method takes into account information on the

              the threshold model in morphological systematics to model the
              evolution of discrete all-or-none traits. There the threshold
              model has the advantage over 0/1 Markov process models in that it

  abstract = "Evolutionary biology is a study of life's history on Earth. In
              researching this history, biologists are often interested in
              attempting to reconstruct phenotypes for the long extinct
              ancestors of living species. Various methods have been developed
              to do this on a phylogeny from the data for extant taxa. In the
              present article, I introduce a new approach for ancestral
              character estimation for discretely valued traits. This approach
              is based on the threshold model from evolutionary quantitative
              genetics. Under the threshold model, the value exhibited by an
              individual or species for a discrete character is determined by
              an underlying, unobserved continuous trait called ``liability.''
              In this new method for ancestral state reconstruction, I use
              Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample the
              liabilities of ancestral and tip species, and the relative
              positions of two or more thresholds, from their joint posterior
              probability distribution. Using data simulated under the model, I
              find that the method has very good performance in ancestral
              character estimation. Use of the threshold model for ancestral
              state reconstruction relies on a priori specification of the
              order of the discrete character states along the liability axis.
              I test the use of a Bayesian MCMC information theoretic criterion
              based approach to choose among different hypothesized orderings
              for the discrete character. Finally, I apply the method to the

               approach published by Brian O'Meara and colleagues in 2006. We
               examine the statistical performance of the method and find that
               it suffers from the typical downward bias expected for maximum
               likelihood estimates of the variance, but only for very small
               trees. We find that evolutionary rates are estimated with
               minimal bias for trees of even relatively modest size. We also
               find that type I error rates based on a likelihood-ratio test
               are minimally elevated above the nominal level, even for small
               phylogenies. The type I error rate can be reduced to a level at

               strategies for taking this uncertainty into consideration during

              combination thereof can influence both the evolution of

              used to model the evolution of two-state discrete characters
              along a phylogeny. The model assumes that there is a quantitative
              character, called liability, that is unobserved and that
              determines the discrete character according to whether the
              liability exceeds a threshold value. A Markov chain Monte Carlo
              algorithm is used to infer the evolutionary covariances of the
              liabilities for discrete characters, sampling liability values
              consistent with the phylogeny and with the observed data. The
              same approach can also be used for continuous characters by
              assuming that the tip species have values that have been
              observed. In this way, one can make a comparative-methods
              analysis that combines both discrete and continuous characters.
              Simulations are presented showing that the covariances of the
              liabilities are successfully estimated, although precision can be
              achieved only by using a large number of species, and we must
              always worry whether the covariances and the model apply
              throughout the group. An advantage of the threshold model is that
              the model can be straightforwardly extended to accommodate

  author   = "Blomberg, Simon P and Garland, Jr, Theodore and Ives, Anthony R",
  abstract = "The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically based
              statistical methods is that phylogenetic signal, the tendency for
              related species to resemble each other, is ubiquitous. Whether
              this assertion is true for a given trait in a given lineage is an
              empirical question, but general tools for detecting and
              quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately developed. We
              present new methods for continuous-valued characters that can be
              implemented with either phylogenetically independent contrasts or
              generalized least-squares models. First, a simple randomization
              procedure allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of
              similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I
              error rate at a nominal alpha = 0.05 and good power (0.8) for
              simulated datasets with 20 or more species. Second, we derive a
              descriptive statistic, K, which allows valid comparisons of the
              amount of phylogenetic signal across traits and trees. Third, we
              provide two biologically motivated branch-length transformations,
              one based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model of stabilizing
              selection, the other based on a new model in which character
              evolution can accelerate or decelerate (ACDC) in rate (e.g., as
              may occur during or after an adaptive radiation). Maximum
              likelihood estimation of the OU (d) and ACDC (g) parameters can
              serve as tests for phylogenetic signal because an estimate of d
              or g near zero implies that a phylogeny with little hierarchical
              structure (a star) offers a good fit to the data. Transformations
              that improve the fit of a tree to comparative data will increase
              power to detect phylogenetic signal and may also be preferable
              for further comparative analyses, such as of correlated character
              evolution. Application of the methods to data from the literature
              revealed that, for trees with 20 or more species, 92\% of traits
              exhibited significant phylogenetic signal (randomization test),
              including behavioral and ecological ones that are thought to be
              relatively evolutionarily malleable (e.g., highly adaptive)
              and/or subject to relatively strong environmental (nongenetic)
              effects or high levels of measurement error. Irrespective of
              sample size, most traits (but not body size, on average) showed
              less signal than expected given the topology, branch lengths, and
              a Brownian motion model of evolution (i.e., K was less than one),
              which may be attributed to adaptation and/or measurement error in
              the broad sense (including errors in estimates of phenotypes,
              branch lengths, and topology). Analysis of variance of log K for
              all 121 traits (from 35 trees) indicated that behavioral traits
              exhibit lower signal than body size, morphological, life-history,
              or physiological traits. In addition, physiological traits
              (corrected for body size) showed less signal than did body size
              itself. For trees with 20 or more species, the estimated OU (25\%
              of traits) and/or ACDC (40\%) transformation parameter differed
              significantly from both zero and unity, indicating that a
              hierarchical tree with less (or occasionally more) structure than
              the original better fit the data and so could be preferred for

               characters between trees. Our method is derived from a previous
               approach published by Brian O'Meara and colleagues in 2006. We
               examine the statistical performance of the method and find that
               it suffers from the typical downward bias expected for maximum
               likelihood estimates of the variance, but only for very small
               trees. We find that evolutionary rates are estimated with
               minimal bias for trees of even relatively modest size. We also
               find that type I error rates based on a likelihood-ratio test
               are minimally elevated above the nominal level, even for small
               phylogenies. The type I error rate can be reduced to a level at
               or below its nominal value by substituting a test-statistic
               distribution obtained via simulation under the null hypothesis
               of no difference in evolutionary rate among trees. We discuss
               the consequences of failing to account for uncertainty in the
               estimation of species means or in the phylogeny, and describe
               strategies for taking this uncertainty into consideration during
               estimation. We also identify how our approach is related to
               previous methods for comparing the rate of evolution among
               different clades of a single tree or between different
               phenotypic traits. Finally, we describe how the method can be
               applied to different evolutionary models and to discrete
               characters?options that are already implemented in software.
               Evolutionary biologists continue to be intrigued by changes in
               the tempo of phenotypic evolution across the tree of life. The
               method described herein should be useful for contexts in which
               changes in the evolutionary rate or process between two or more
               clades of distant or unknown relationship are of interest.",

               is a new program for canonical correlation analysis of
               multivariate, continuously valued data from biological species.
               Canonical correlation analysis is a technique in which derived
               variables are obtained from two sets of original variables
               whereby the correlations between corresponding derived variables
               are maximized. It is a very useful multivariate statistical
               method for the calculation and analysis of correlations between
               character sets. The program controls for species
               non-independence due to phylogenetic history and computes
               canonical coefficients, correlations and scores; and conducts
               hypothesis tests on the canonical correlations. It can also
               compute a multivariate version of Pagel's lambda, which can then
               be used in the phylogenetic transformation. AVAILABILITY: PCCA

  abstract  = "Theories of ecological diversification make predictions about
               the timing and ordering of character state changes through
               history. These theories are testable by ``reconstructing''
               ancestor states using phylogenetic trees and measurements of
               contemporary species. Here we use maximum likelihood to estimate
               and evaluate the accuracy of ancestor reconstructions. We
               present likelihoods of discrete ancestor states and derive
               probability distributions for continuous ancestral traits. The
               methods are applied to several examples: diets of ancestral
               Darwin's finches; origin of inquilinism in gall wasps;
               microhabitat partitioning and body size evolution in scrubwrens;
               digestive enzyme evolution in artiodactyl mammals; origin of a
               sexually selected male trait, the sword, in platies and
               swordtails; and evolution of specialization in Anolis lizards.
               When changes between discrete character states are rare, the
               maximum-likelihood results are similar to parsimony estimates.
               In this case the accuracy of estimates is often high, with the
               exception of some nodes deep in the tree. If change is frequent
               then reconstructions are highly uncertain, especially of distant
               ancestors. Ancestor states for continuous traits are typically
               highly uncertain. We conclude that measures of uncertainty are
               useful and should always be provided, despite simplistic
               assumptions about the probabilistic models that underlie them.
               If uncertainty is too high, reconstruction should be abandoned
               in favor of approaches that fit different models of trait
               evolution to species data and phylogenetic trees, taking into
               account the range of ancestor states permitted by the data.",

               species on Earth. Overwhelmingly, this progress toward building
               an ever increasingly complete phylogeny of living things has
               been accomplished through sophisticated analysis of molecular
               data. In the modern genomic age, molecular genetic data have
               become very easy and inexpensive to obtain for many species.
               However, some lineages are poorly represented in or absent from
               tissue collections, or are unavailable for molecular analysis
               for other reasons such as restrictive biological sample export
               laws. Other species went extinct recently and are only available
               in formalin museum preparations or perhaps even as subfossils.
               In this brief communication we present a new method for placing
               cryptic, recently extinct, or hypothesized taxa into an
               ultrametric phylogeny of extant taxa using continuous character
               data. This method is based on a relatively simple modification
               of an established maximum likelihood (ML) method for phylogeny
               inference from continuous traits. We show that the method works
               well on simulated trees and data. We then apply it to the case
               of placing the Culebra Island Giant Anole (Anolis roosevelti)

               Islands, but that has not been encountered or collected since
               the 1930s. Although this species is widely thought to be closely
               related to the Puerto Rican giant anole, A. cuvieri, our ML
               method actually places A. roosevelti in a different part of the
               tree and closely related to a clade of morphologically similar
               species. We are unable, however, to reject a phylogenetic

               convergent adaptation if the similarities did not evolve as a
               result of the same selection pressures; an alternative
               possibility is that the similar features evolved for different
               reasons, but subsequently allowed the species to occupy the same
               habitat, in which case the convergent evolution of the same
               feature by species occupying similar habitats would be the
               result of exaptation. Many lizard lineages have evolved to
               occupy vertical rock surfaces, a habitat that places strong
               functional and ecological demands on lizards. We examined four
               clades in which species that use vertical rock surfaces exhibit

               were associated with increases in limb length and decreases in
               head depth. Examination of particular characters revealed
               several different patterns of evolutionary change. Rock-dwelling
               lizards exhibited similarities in head depth as a result of both
               adaptation and exaptation. Moreover, even though rock-dwelling
               species generally had longer limbs than their close relatives,
               clade-level differences in limb length led to an overall lack of
               difference between rock- and non-rock-dwelling lizards. These
               results indicate that evolutionary change in the same direction
               in independent lineages does not necessarily produce
               convergence, and that the existence of similar advantageous

  abstract = "Over the past decade or so it has become increasingly popular to
              use reconstructed evolutionary trees to investigate questions
              about the rates of speciation and extinction. Although the
              methodology of this field has grown substantially in its
              sophistication in recent years, here I will take a step back to
              present a very simple model that is designed to investigate the
              relatively straightforward question of whether the tempo of
              diversification (speciation and extinction) differs between two
              or more phylogenetic trees, without attempting to attribute a
              causal basis to this difference. It is a likelihood method, and I
              demonstrate that it generally shows type I error that is close to
              the nominal level. I also demonstrate that parameter estimates
              obtained with this approach are largely unbiased. As this method
              can be used to compare trees of unknown relationship, it will be
              particularly well-suited to problems in which a difference in
              diversification rate between clades is suspected, but in which
              these clades are not particularly closely related. As
              diversification methods can easily take into account an
              incomplete sampling fraction, but missing lineages are assumed to
              be missing at random, this method is also appropriate for cases
              in which we have hypothesized a difference in the process of
              diversification between two or more focal clades, but in which
              many unsampled groups separate the few of interest. The method of
              this study is by no means an attempt to replace more
              sophisticated models in which, for instance, diversification
              depends on the state of an observed or unobserved discrete or
              continuous trait. Rather, my intention is to provide a
              complementary approach for circumstances in which a simpler
              hypothesis is warranted and of biological interest.",

  author    = "Caraballo, Diego A",
  abstract  = "Bats harbor the largest number of coronavirus (CoV) species
               among mammals, serving as major reservoirs of alphaCoVs and
               betaCoVs, which can jump between bat species or to different
               mammalian hosts, including humans. Bat-CoV diversity is
               correlated with host taxonomic diversity, with the highest
               number of CoV species found in areas with the highest levels of
               bat species richness. Although the Americas harbor a unique and
               distinctive CoV diversity, no cross-species transmission (CST)
               or phylogeographic analysis has yet been performed. This study
               analyzes a large sequence data set from across the Americas
               through a Bayesian framework to understand how codivergence and
               cross-species transmission have shaped long-term bat-CoV
               evolution and ultimately identify bat hosts and regions where
               the risk of CST is the highest. Substantial levels of CST were
               found only among alphaCoVs. In contrast, cospeciation prevailed
               along the evolution of betaCoVs. Brazil is the center of
               diversification for both alpha and betaCoVs, with the highest
               levels of bat species richness. The bat family Phyllostomidae
               has played a key role in the evolution of American bat-CoVs,
               supported by the highest values of host transition rates.
               Although the conclusions drawn from this study are supported by
               biological/ecological evidence, it is likely that novel lineages
               will be discovered, which could also reveal undetected CSTs
               given that sequences are available from 11 of the 35 countries
               encompassing the Americas. The findings of this study can be
               useful for conducting targeted discovery of bat-CoVs in the
               region, especially in countries of the Americas with no reported
               sequences. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) have a strong
               zoonotic potential due to their high rates of evolvability and
               their capacity for overcoming host-specific barriers. Bats

               highest CoV diversity found in areas with the highest levels of
               bat species richness. Understanding their origin and patterns of
               cross-species transmission is crucial for pandemic preparedness.
               This study aims to understand how bat-CoVs diversify in the
               Americas, circulate among and transmit between bat families and
               genera, and ultimately identify bat hosts and regions where the

  abstract  = "We discuss and clarify several aspects of applying Felsenstein's
               (1985, Am. Nat. 125: 1--15) procedures to test for correlated
               evolution of continuous traits. This is one of several available
               comparative methods that maps data for phenotypic traits onto an
               existing phylogenetic tree (derived from independent
               information). Application of Felsenstein's method does not
               require an entirely dichotomous topology. It also does not
               require an assumption of gradual, clocklike character evolution,
               as might be modeled by Brownian motion. Almost any available
               information can be used to estimate branch lengths (e.g.,
               genetic distances, divergence times estimated from the fossil
               record or from molecular clocks, numbers of character changes
               from a cladistic analysis). However, the adequacy for
               statistical purposes of any proposed branch lengths must be
               verified empirically for each phytogeny and for each character.
               We suggest a simple way of doing this, based on graphical
               analysis of plots of standardized independent contrasts versus
               their standard deviations (i.e., the square roots of the sums of
               their branch lengths). In some cases, the branch lengths and/or
               the values of traits being studied will require transformation.
               An example involving the scaling of mammalian home range area is
               presented. Once adequately standardized, sets of independent
               contrasts can be analyzed using either linear or nonlinear
               (multiple) regression. In all cases, however, regressions (or
               correlations) must be computed through the origin. We also
               discuss ways of correcting for body size effects and how this
               relates to making graphical representations of relationships of
               standardized independent contrasts. We close with a
               consideration of the types of traits that can be analyzed with
               independent contrasts procedures and conclude that any
               (continuous) trait that is inherited from ancestors is
               appropriate for analysis, regardless of the mechanism of
               inheritance (e.g., genetic or cultural).",

               evolutionary biology. Projecting families of phylogenies into
               multivariate morphospaces can distinguish two scenarios
               potentially leading to unequal morphological diversification:
               unequal magnitude of change per phylogenetic branch, and unequal
               efficiency in morphological innovation. This approach is
               demonstrated using a case study of skulls in sister clades
               within the South American fish superfamily Anostomoidea. Unequal
               morphological diversification in this system resulted not from
               the morphologically diverse clade changing more on each
               phylogenetic branch, but from that clade distributing an equal
               amount of change more widely through morphospace and innovating
               continually. Although substantial morphological evolution
               occurred throughout the less diverse clade's history, most of
               that clade's expansion in morphospace occurred in the most basal
               branches, and more derived portions of that radiation oscillated
               within previously explored limits. Because simulations revealed
               that there is a maximum 2.7\% probability of generating two
               clades that differ so greatly in the density of lineages within
               morphospace under a null Brownian model, the observed difference

              50-150 years old. This work demonstrates the urgent need to

               available optrA-positive E. faecalis genomes from different
               hosts in seven countries. At the genome-level analysis, an
               in-house database with 64 virulence genes was tested for the
               first time. Our analysis showed a diversity of clones and
               adaptive gene sequences related to a wide range of genera from
               Firmicutes. Phylogenies of core and accessory genomes were not
               congruent, and at least PAI-associated and prophage genes

               and animal hosts in different continents over eight years
               (2010-2017) could be phylogenetically related (3-126 SNPs
               difference). optrA was located on the chromosome within a
               Tn6674-like element (n=10) or on medium-size plasmids (30-60 kb;
               n=14) belonging to main plasmid families (RepA\_N/Inc18/Rep\_3).
               In most cases, the immediate gene vicinity of optrA was
               generally identical in chromosomal (Tn6674) or plasmid
               (impB-fexA-optrA) backbones. Tn6674 was always inserted into the

               platform common to strains from different origins (patients,
               healthy humans, and animals) in Europe, Africa, and Asia during
               2012-2017. This platform is conserved among hundreds of E.

               in Drosophila Using a comparative ecological, phylogenetic, and
               behavioral approach, the different properties of SINs formed by
               20 drosophilids were compared. We investigate whether
               drosophilid network structures arise from common ancestry, a
               response to the species' past climate, other social behaviors,
               or a combination of these factors. This study shows that
               differences in past climate predicted the species' current SIN
               properties. The drosophilid phylogeny offered no value to
               predicting species' differences in SINs through phylogenetic
               signal tests. This suggests that group-level social behaviors in
               drosophilid species are shaped by divergent climates. However,
               we find that the social distance at which flies interact
               correlated with the drosophilid phylogeny, indicating that
               behavioral elements of SINs have remained largely unchanged in
               their evolutionary history. We find a significant correlation of
               leg length to social distance, outlining the interdependence of
               anatomy and complex social structures. Although SINs display a
               complex evolutionary relationship across drosophilids, this

               phase in human evolution, overlapping with the earliest
               emergence of Homo sapiens as well as the expansions of these
               populations across and beyond Africa. Within the context of
               growing recognition for a complex and structured population
               history across the continent, Eastern Africa remains a critical
               region to explore patterns of behavioural variability due to the
               large number of well-dated archaeological assemblages compared
               to other regions. Quantitative studies of the Eastern African
               MSA record have indicated patterns of behavioural variation
               across space, time and from different environmental contexts.
               Here, we examine the nature of these patterns through the use of
               matrix correlation statistics, exploring whether differences in
               assemblage composition and raw material use correlate to
               differences between one another, assemblage age, distance in
               space, and the geographic and environmental characteristics of
               the landscapes surrounding MSA sites. Assemblage composition and
               raw material use correlate most strongly with one another, with
               site type as well as geographic and environmental variables also

               distance in time and space correlating more strongly with the

               of linear chromosomes, shorten during cell division and are
               implicated in senescence in most species. Telomerase can rebuild
               telomeres but is repressed in many mammals that exhibit
               replicative senescence, presumably as a tumour suppression
               mechanism. It is therefore important to understand the
               co-evolution of telomere biology and life-history traits that
               has shaped the diversity of senescence patterns across species.
               Gomes et al. previously produced a large data set on telomere
               length (TL), telomerase activity, body mass and lifespan among
               57 mammal species. We re-analysed their data using the same
               phylogenetic multiple regressions and with several additional
               analyses to test the robustness of the findings. We found
               substantial inconsistencies in our results compared to Gomes et
               al.'s. Consistent with Gomes et al. we found an inverse
               association between TL and lifespan. Contrary to the analyses in
               Gomes et al., we found a generally robust inverse association
               between TL and mass, and only weak nonrobust evidence for an
               association between telomerase activity and mass. These results
               suggest that shorter TL may have been selected for in larger and
               longer lived species, probably as a mechanism to suppress
               cancer. We support this hypothesis by showing that longer
               telomeres predict higher cancer risk across 22 species.
               Furthermore, we find that domesticated species have longer
               telomeres. Our results call into question past interpretations
               of the co-evolution of telomere biology and life-history traits
               and stress the need for careful attention to model construction.",

               transmission in Canada in the first two waves of 2020 and early

               viruses' geographic origins, enabling identification of 2263
               (95\% confidence interval: 2159-2366) introductions, including
               680 (658-703) Canadian sublineages, which are international

               introduced into Quebec (39\%) and Ontario (36\%), while in the

               of human disease. Despite their importance and ubiquity, the
               timescale of flavivirid evolution is uncertain. An ancient
               origin, spanning millions of years, is supported by their
               presence in both vertebrates and invertebrates and by the
               identification of a flavivirus-derived endogenous viral element
               in the peach blossom jellyfish genome (Craspedacusta sowerbii,
               phylum Cnidaria), implying that the flaviviruses arose early in
               the evolution of the Metazoa. To date, however, no exogenous
               flavivirid sequences have been identified in these hosts. To
               help resolve the antiquity of the Flaviviridae, we mined
               publicly available transcriptome data across the Metazoa. From
               this, we expanded the diversity within the family through the
               identification of 32 novel viral sequences and extended the host
               range of the pestiviruses to include amphibians, reptiles, and

               cross-species transmission to be the predominate
               macroevolutionary event across the non-vectored flavivirid
               genera (median, 68 per cent), including a cross-species
               transmission event between bats and rodents, although long-term
               virus-host co-divergence was still a regular occurrence (median,

               in basal metazoan species, including the first associated with
               Cnidaria. This sequence formed a basal lineage to the genus
               Flavivirus and was closer to arthropod and crustacean
               flaviviruses than those in the tamanavirus group, which includes
               a variety of invertebrate and vertebrate viruses. Combined,
               these data attest to an ancient origin of the flaviviruses,

              adaptive evolution. However, none of the popular methods model
              selection directly. We explain and develop a method based on the
              Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, first proposed by Hansen.
              Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models incorporate both selection and drift
              and are thus qualitatively different from, and more general than,
              pure drift models based on Brownian motion. Most importantly, OU
              models possess selective optima that formalize the notion of
              adaptive zone. In this article, we develop the method for one
              quantitative character, discuss interpretations of its
              parameters, and provide code implementing the method. Our
              approach allows us to translate hypotheses regarding adaptation
              in different selective regimes into explicit models, to test the
              models against data using maximum-likelihood-based model
              selection techniques, and to infer details of the evolutionary
              process. We illustrate the method using two worked examples.
              Relative to existing approaches, the direct modeling approach we
              demonstrate allows one to explore more detailed hypotheses and to
              utilize more of the information content of comparative data sets

               the state of a particular character has been of long-standing
               interest to evolutionary biologists. To assess the effect of a
               character on diversification rates using likelihood methods
               requires that we be able to calculate the probability that a
               group of extant species would have evolved as observed, given a
               particular model of the character's effect. Here we describe how

               two-state (binary) character under a simple model of evolution
               (the ``BiSSE'' model, binary-state speciation and extinction).
               The model involves six parameters, specifying two speciation
               rates (rate when the lineage is in state 0; rate when in state
               1), two extinction rates (when in state 0; when in state 1), and
               two rates of character state change (from 0 to 1, and from 1 to
               0). Using these probability calculations, we can do maximum
               likelihood inference to estimate the model's parameters and

               elevated for one character state over the other?). We

              few decades, the field has remained strangely divorced from
              evolutionary genetics. In particular, comparative methods have
              failed to incorporate multivariate process models of
              microevolution that include genetic constraint in the form of the

              combination thereof can influence both the evolution of

              can often be mapped on a phylogenetic tree to examine their

              correlations are a function) elsewhere. To illustrate our

              suggest that there are fundamental limits to biodiversity,
              possibly arising from constraints in the availability of space,
              resources, or ecological niches. Under this hypothesis,
              speciation rates decay over time and biodiversity eventually
              saturates, with new species emerging only when others are driven
              to extinction. This view of macro-evolution contradicts an
              alternative hypothesis that biodiversity is unbounded, with
              species ever accumulating as they find new niches to occupy.
              These contrasting theories of biodiversity dynamics yield
              fundamentally different explanations for the disparity in species
              richness across taxa and regions. Here, we test whether
              speciation rates have decayed or remained constant over time, and
              whether biodiversity is saturated or still expanding. We first
              derive a general likelihood expression for internode distances in
              a phylogeny, based on the well-known coalescent process from
              population genetics. This expression accounts for either
              time-constant or time-variable rates, time-constant or
              time-variable diversity, and completely or incompletely sampled
              phylogenies. We then compare the performance of different
              diversification scenarios in explaining a set of 289 phylogenies
              representing amphibians, arthropods, birds, mammals, mollusks,
              and flowering plants. Our results indicate that speciation rates
              typically decay over time, but that diversity is still expanding
              at present. The evidence for expanding-diversity models suggests
              that an upper limit to biodiversity has not yet been reached, or
              that no such limit exists.",

  abstract = "In this article we propose a new framework for studying adaptive
              radiations in the context of diversity-dependent diversification.
              Diversity dependence causes diversification to decelerate at the
              end of an adaptive radiation but also plays a key role in the
              initial pulse of diversification. In particular, key innovations
              (which in our definition include novel traits as well as new
              environments) may cause decoupling of the diversity-dependent
              dynamics of the innovative clade from the diversity-dependent
              dynamics of its ancestral clade. We present a likelihood-based
              inference method to test for decoupling of diversity dependence
              using molecular phylogenies. The method, which can handle
              incomplete phylogenies, identifies when the decoupling took place
              and which diversification parameters are affected. We illustrate
              our approach by applying it to the molecular phylogeny of the
              North American clade of the legume tribe Psoraleeae (47 extant
              species, of which 4 are missing). Two diversification rate shifts
              were previously identified for this clade; our analysis shows
              that the first, positive shift can be associated with decoupling
              of two Pediomelum subgenera from the other Psoraleeae lineages,
              while we argue that the second, negative shift can be attributed
              to speciation being protracted. The latter explanation yields
              nonzero extinction rates, in contrast to previous findings. Our
              framework offers a new perspective on macroevolution: new
              environments and novel traits (ecological opportunity) and
              diversity dependence (ecological limits) cannot be considered

               lineage diversification-intersect in the study of plant breeding
               systems. Transitions from self-incompatibility to
               self-compatibility are frequent, and they may proceed within a
               species (``anagenetic'' mode of breeding system change) or in
               conjunction with speciation events (``cladogenetic'' mode of
               change). We apply a recently developed phylogenetic model to the
               nightshade family Solanaceae, quantifying the relative
               contributions of these two modes of evolution along with the
               tempo of breeding system change, speciation, and extinction. We
               find that self-incompatibility, a genetic mechanism that
               prevents self-fertilization, is lost largely by the cladogenetic
               mode. Self-compatible species are thus more likely to arise from
               the isolation of a newly self-compatible population than from
               species-wide fixation of self-compatible mutants. Shared
               polymorphism at the locus that governs self-incompatibility
               shows it to be ancestral and not regained within this family. We

               developed a method that can identify arbitrary numbers of
               time-varying diversification processes on phylogenies without
               specifying their locations in advance. The method uses
               reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo to move between model
               subspaces that vary in the number of distinct diversification
               regimes. The model assumes that changes in evolutionary regimes
               occur across the branches of phylogenetic trees under a compound

              phylogenetic comparative methods. Widely used Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
              (OU) models can describe an adaptive process of divergence and
              selection. However, inference of the dynamics of adaptive
              landscapes from comparative data is complicated by
              interpretational difficulties, lack of identifiability among
              parameter values and the common requirement that adaptive
              hypotheses must be assigned a priori. Here, we develop a

  abstract = "The distribution of diversity can vary considerably from clade to
              clade. Attempts to understand these patterns often employ
              state-dependent speciation and extinction models to determine
              whether the evolution of a particular novel trait has increased
              speciation rates and/or decreased extinction rates. It is still
              unclear, however, whether these models are uncovering important
              drivers of diversification, or whether they are simply pointing
              to more complex patterns involving many unmeasured and
              co-distributed factors. Here we describe an extension to the
              popular state-dependent speciation and extinction models that
              specifically accounts for the presence of unmeasured factors that
              could impact diversification rates estimated for the states of
              any observed trait, addressing at least one major criticism of
              BiSSE (Binary State Speciation and Extinction) methods.
              Specifically, our model, which we refer to as HiSSE (Hidden State
              Speciation and Extinction), assumes that related to each observed
              state in the model are ``hidden'' states that exhibit potentially
              distinct diversification dynamics and transition rates than the
              observed states in isolation. We also demonstrate how our model
              can be used as character-independent diversification models that
              allow for a complex diversification process that is independent
              of the evolution of a character. Under rigorous simulation tests
              and when applied to empirical data, we find that HiSSE performs
              reasonably well, and can at least detect net diversification rate
              differences between observed and hidden states and detect when
              diversification rate differences do not correlate with the
              observed states. We discuss the remaining issues with
              state-dependent speciation and extinction models in general, and
              the important ways in which HiSSE provides a more nuanced
              understanding of trait-dependent diversification.",

               evolved sets of species with similar ecologies and morphologies
               (ecomorphs). However, it is unclear whether closely related
               anoles from Central and South America exhibit similar patterns
               of diversification. We generated an extensive morphological data
               set to test whether mainland Draconura-clade anoles are
               assignable to the Caribbean ecomorphs. Based on a new
               classification framework that accounts for different degrees of
               morphological support, we found morphological evidence for
               mainland representatives of all six Caribbean ecomorphs and
               evidence that many ecomorphs have also evolved repeatedly on the
               mainland. We also found strong evidence that ground-dwelling
               anoles from both the Caribbean and the mainland constitute a new
               and distinct ecomorph class. Beyond the ecomorph concept, we
               show that the island and mainland anole faunas exhibit
               exceptional morphological convergence, suggesting that they are
               more similar than previously understood. However, the island and

  abstract  = "PREMISE: The woody plant group Memecylon (Melastomataceae) is a
               large clade occupying diverse forest habitats in the Old World
               tropics and exhibiting high regional endemism. Its phylogenetic
               relationships have been previously studied using ribosomal DNA
               with extensive sampling from Africa and Madagascar. However,
               divergence times, biogeography, and character evolution of
               Memecylon remain uninvestigated. We present a phylogenomic
               analysis of Memecylon to provide a broad evolutionary
               perspective of this clade. METHODS: One hundred supercontigs of
               67 Memecylon taxa were harvested from target enrichment. The
               data were subjected to coalescent and concatenated phylogenetic
               analyses. A timeline was provided for Memecylon evolution using
               fossils and secondary calibration. The calibrated Memecylon
               phylogeny was used to elucidate its biogeography and ancestral
               character states. RESULTS: Relationships recovered by the
               phylogenomic analyses are strongly supported in both maximum
               likelihood and coalescent-based species trees. Memecylon is
               inferred to have originated in Africa in the Eocene and
               subsequently dispersed predominantly eastward via long-distance
               dispersal (LDD), although a reverse dispersal from South Asia
               westward to the Seychelles was postulated. Morphological data
               exhibited high levels of homoplasy, but also showed that several
               vegetative and reproductive characters were phylogenetically
               informative. CONCLUSIONS: The current distribution of Memecylon
               appears to be the result of multiple ancestral LDD events. Our
               results demonstrate the importance of the combined effect of
               geographic and paleoclimatic factors in shaping the distribution
               of this group in the Old World tropics. Memecylon includes a

               contribute significantly to the structure of herbivore
               assemblages and the high alpha diversity of plants in tropical
               rain forests. However, the general importance of plant defenses
               in host associations and divergence at regional scales remains
               unclear. Here, we examine the role of plant defensive traits and
               phylogeny in the evolution of host range and species divergence
               in leaf-feeding sawflies of the family Argidae associated with
               Neotropical trees in the genus Inga throughout the Amazon, the
               Guiana Shield and Panama. Our analyses show that the phylogenies
               of both the sawfly herbivores and their Inga hosts are
               congruent, and that sawflies radiated at approximately the same
               time, or more recently than their Inga hosts. Analyses
               controlling for phylogenetic effects show that the evolution of
               host use in the sawflies associated with Inga is better
               correlated with Inga chemistry than with Inga phylogeny,
               suggesting a pattern of delayed host tracking closely tied to
               host chemistry. Finally, phylogenetic analyses show that sister
               species of Inga-sawflies are dispersed across the Neotropics,
               suggesting a role for allopatric divergence and vicariance in
               Inga diversification. These results are consistent with the idea
               that host defensive traits play a key role not only in
               structuring the herbivore assemblages at a single site, but also

               However, there are alternative evolutionary mechanisms that may
               also lead to the evolution of phenotypic divergence between
               sympatric species; one of the mechanisms is evolutionary
               contingency. We studied the evolution of the presence and
               absence of a major male horn phenotype, which may have
               ecological implications for promoting coexistence between
               sympatric beetles, across geographic populations from different
               Xylotrupes beetles. By using a previously published phylogeny
               with 80 Xylotrupes taxa, we estimated the transition rates

               Here we sought to determine whether this had resulted from

               divergence occurred in a biogeographical context of allopatry
               followed by secondary contact, or via isolation-by-distance
               across the species' historical range. We first estimated a
               mitochondrial gene tree for 379 samples and then genotyped 3407
               single nucleotide polymorphic sites from 48 individuals using a
               modified genotyping-by-sequencing approach. We found that A.
               cristatellus samples from Vieques belong to two highly divergent
               mitochondrial subclades, but the geographical distribution of
               these haplogroups indicates that this pattern is probably
               natural in origin. Analysis of our single nucleotide polymorphic
               dataset revealed differentiation that is consistent with
               isolation-by-distance between the western and eastern ends of
               Vieques, suggesting that the overall pattern of divergence

               break on the historical Puerto Rico Bank palaeo-island that
               happened to coincide with the present-day location of Vieques.

               division. Among decapod crustaceans, caridean shrimps are among
               the most variable both in terms of genome size variation and
               life-history characteristics such as larval development mode and
               egg size, but the extent to which these traits are associated in
               a phylogenetic context is largely unknown. In this study, we
               examine correlations among egg size, larval development and
               genome size in two different genera of snapping shrimp, Alpheus

               both Alpheus and Synalpheus, egg size is strongly linked to

               analyses suggest that changes in development mode (from extended

               This pathogen has high intrinsic resistance to most

               high-risk ST-111 strain with resistance to multiple antibiotics,
               including carbapenems, due to the activity of VIM-2 and IMP-18

               by RT-qPCR. To select related genomes to PaeAG1, we implemented
               a pan-genome analysis to define and up-date the phylogenetic
               relationship among complete P. aeruginosa genomes. We also
               studied the PaeAG1 genomic islands content in the related

               evolutionary steps of the genomic regions around the VIM-2- and
               IMP-18-carrying integrons. Expression of VIM-2 and IMP-18 genes

               are able to separate clones by MLST profile, including a clear
               ST-111 cluster with PaeAG1. The PaeAG1 genomic islands were
               found to define a diverse presence/absence pattern among related

               showed that VIM-2-carrying integron (In59-like) is an
               old-acquaintance element harbored in the same known region found
               in other two ST-111 strains. Also, PaeAG1 has an exclusive

  abstract  = "Quantitative traits have long been hypothesized to affect
               speciation and extinction rates. For example, smaller body size
               or increased specialization may be associated with increased
               rates of diversification. Here, I present a phylogenetic
               likelihood-based method (quantitative state speciation and
               extinction [QuaSSE]) that can be used to test such hypotheses
               using extant character distributions. This approach assumes that
               diversification follows a birth-death process where speciation
               and extinction rates may vary with one or more traits that
               evolve under a diffusion model. Speciation and extinction rates
               may be arbitrary functions of the character state, allowing much
               flexibility in testing models of trait-dependent
               diversification. I test the approach using simulated phylogenies
               and show that a known relationship between speciation and a
               quantitative character could be recovered in up to 80\% of the
               cases on large trees (500 species). Consistent with other
               approaches, detecting shifts in diversification due to
               differences in extinction rates was harder than when due to
               differences in speciation rates. Finally, I demonstrate the
               application of QuaSSE to investigate the correlation between
               body size and diversification in primates, concluding that
               clade-specific differences in diversification may be more
               important than size-dependent diversification in shaping the
               patterns of diversity within this group.",

  author   = "Friedman, S T and Price, S A and Hoey, A S and Wainwright, P C",
  abstract = "Morphological convergence plays a central role in the study of
              evolution. Often induced by shared ecological specialization,
              homoplasy hints at underlying selective pressures and adaptive
              constraints that deterministically shape the diversification of
              life. Although midwater zooplanktivory has arisen in adult
              surgeonfishes (family Acanthuridae) at least four independent
              times, it represents a clearly specialized state, requiring the
              capacity to swiftly swim in midwater locating and sucking small
              prey items. Whereas this diet has commonly been associated with
              specific functional adaptations in fishes, acanthurids present an
              interesting case study as all nonplanktivorous species feed by
              grazing on benthic algae and detritus, requiring a vastly
              different functional morphology that emphasizes biting
              behaviours. We examined the feeding morphology in 30 acanthurid
              species and, combined with a pre-existing phylogenetic tree,
              compared the fit of evolutionary models across two diet regimes:
              zooplanktivores and nonzooplanktivorous grazers. Accounting for
              phylogenetic relationships, the best-fitting model indicates that
              zooplanktivorous species are converging on a separate adaptive
              peak from their grazing relatives. Driving this bimodal
              landscape, zooplanktivorous acanthurids tend to develop a slender
              body, reduced facial features, smaller teeth and weakened jaw
              adductor muscles. However, despite these phenotypic changes,
              model fitting suggests that lineages have not yet reached the
              adaptive peak associated with plankton feeding even though some
              transitions appear to be over 10 million years old. These
              findings demonstrate that the selective demands of pelagic
              feeding promote repeated - albeit very gradual - ecomorphological
              convergence within surgeonfishes, while allowing local
              divergences between closely related species, contributing to the
              overall diversity of the clade.",

               environmental factors, body size and the role of evolutionary
               rate. Here, we analysed RBC morphometrics in a set of Teleostei
               (bony fishes) and Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays) species
               testing the hypothesis that phylogenetic relationship explains
               species occupation of morphospace. We collected data on cell and
               nucleus area and volume, nucleus:cytoplasm ratio and shape
               factor for 65 species belonging to 28 orders. Then, we built
               phylomorphospaces separately for bony fish and sharks and rays.
               To test whether phylogenetic relationships predicted phenotypic
               similarity, we calculated multivariate phylogenetic signal. We
               also estimated the evolutionary rate of RBC shape for each node
               and tip using ridge regression. Finally, we tested whether
               habitat and body size influenced RBC shape using a PGLS. We
               found a significant phylogenetic signal in RBC shape for bony
               fish, but not sharks and rays. Saltwater teleost species were
               more clustered than freshwater ones in the phylomorphospace,
               suggesting clade disparity. Accordingly, the rate of evolution
               was highly heterogeneous, with significant decrease in
               Acanthopterygii. Neither habitat nor body size influenced RBC
               shape. In conclusion, RBC shape seems to have evolved in fishes

               The former is critical to feeding, mating, and predator
               avoidance behaviors, while the latter is essential for
               homeothermy. Aquatic and amphibious mammals face olfactory and
               thermoregulatory challenges not generally encountered by
               terrestrial species. In mammals, the nasal cavity houses a bony
               system supporting soft tissues and sensory organs implicated in
               either olfactory or thermoregulatory functions. It is
               hypothesized that to cope with aquatic environments, amphibious
               mammals have expanded their thermoregulatory capacity at the
               expense of their olfactory system. We investigated the
               evolutionary history of this potential trade-off using a
               comparative dataset of three-dimensional (3D) CT scans of 189
               skulls, capturing 17 independent transitions from a strictly
               terrestrial to an amphibious lifestyle across small mammals
               (Afrosoricida, Eulipotyphla, and Rodentia). We identified rapid
               and repeated loss of olfactory capacities synchronously
               associated with gains in thermoregulatory capacity in amphibious
               taxa sampled from across mammalian phylogenetic diversity.
               Evolutionary models further reveal that these convergences
               result from faster rates of turbinal bone evolution and release
               of selective constraints on the thermoregulatory-olfaction
               trade-off in amphibious species. Lastly, we demonstrated that

               diversification of the iconic Neotropical butterfly genus

               species and inferred historical biogeography. We fitted models
               of time-dependent (accounting for rate heterogeneity across the

               (accounting for global effect on the phylogeny). We used

               shape across the tree and investigated their dynamics of

               explained when considering variable diversification rates across
               the tree, possibly associated with lineages occupying different
               microhabitat conditions. First, a shift from understory to
               canopy was characterized by an increased speciation rate
               partially coupled with an increasing rate of wing shape
               evolution. Second, the occupation of dense bamboo thickets
               accompanying a major host-plant shift from dicotyledons towards
               monocotyledons was associated with a simultaneous
               diversification rate shift and an evolutionary 'jump' of wing
               size. Our study points to a diversification pattern driven by
