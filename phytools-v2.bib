  abstract = "Comparative studies of the relationship between two phenotypes,
              or between a phenotype and an environment, are frequently carried
              out by invalid statistical methods. Most regression, correlation,
              and contingency table methods, including nonparametric methods,
              assume that the points are drawn independently from a common
              distribution. When species are taken from a branching phylogeny,
              they are manifestly nonindependent. Use of a statistical method
              that assumes independence will cause overstatement of the
              significance in hypothesis tests. Some illustrative examples of
              these phenomena have been given, and limitations of previous
              proposals of ways to correct for the nonindependence have been
              discussed. A method of correcting for the phylogeny has been
              proposed. It requires that we know both the tree topology and the
              branch lengths, and that we be willing to allow the characters to
              be modeled by Brownian motion on a linear scale. Given these
              conditions, the phylogeny specifies a set of contrasts among
              species, contrasts that are statistically independent and can be
              used in regression or correlation studies. The considerable
              barriers to making practical use of this technique have been
              discussed.",

               phylogenetics and evolution) software package has grown steadily
               over the years. Among its features, it has a strong
               distance-based component allowing the user to compute distances
               from aligned DNA sequences based on most methods from the
               literature and also build phylogenetic trees from them. However,
               even data generated with modern genomic approaches can fail to
               give rise to sufficiently reliable distance estimates. One way
               to overcome this problem is to exclude such estimates from data
               analysis giving rise to an incomplete distance data set (as
               opposed to a complete one). So far their analysis has been out
               of reach for ape. To remedy this, we have incorporated into ape
               several methods from the literature for phylogenetic inference
               from incomplete distance matrices. In addition, we have also
               extended ape's repertoire for phylogenetic inference from
               complete distances, added a new object class to efficiently
               encode sets of splits of taxa, and extended the functionality of
               some of its existing functions. AVAILABILITY: ape is distributed
